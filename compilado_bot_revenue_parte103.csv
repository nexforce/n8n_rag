2557,Understand SEO crawling errors,"If an SEO crawler can't index a page, it will return a crawling error. This can happen with the crawlers in HubSpot's SEO and import tools, as well as external crawlers like Semrush. The steps for resolving a crawling error depend on the error and where the page is hosted. HubSpot's SEO tools crawling a HubSpot page You can view SEO recommendations on the Optimization tab of a page or post's performance details . If there are issues crawling the page, you may see one of the following error messages: Status 301: Moved Permanently : a 301 redirect is preventing the crawler from accessing the content. Status 302: Object moved : a 302 (temporary) redirect is preventing the crawler from accessing the content. Status 403: Forbidden : the server can be reached, but access to content is denied. Status 404: Not Found : the crawler is unable to find a live version of the content because it was deleted or moved. Crawl of [site] blocked by robots.txt : a robots.txt file is blocking the content from being indexed. HubSpot's SEO tools crawling an external page If you have attempted to crawl external pages using HubSpot's SEO tools or are importing external content to HubSpot , you may encounter one of these errors: Scan blocked by robots.txt file : if your external page is excluded from indexing by your robots.txt file, add the HubSpot crawler’s user agent “HubSpot Crawler” as an exemption.

Common causes for this issue include: The inclusion of your pages in the robots.txt file is preventing them from being indexed or crawled. A ""noindex"" meta tag in the head HTML of your pages is preventing them from being indexed or crawled. Auditing a root domain, rather than the subdomain connected to HubSpot , is causing a timeout error. Links for RSS feeds and blog listing pages expire when new blog posts are published, which can generate blocked resources errors. Non-essential resources, such as the scripts that load the HubSpot sprocket menu, may prompt blocked resources errors.

Para garantir que as empresas e os negócios são associados correctamente quando sincronizados a partir do Salesforce, a sincronização da empresa deve ser ligada para a integração do Salesforce e a importação de uma conta Salesforce deve ser completada. Se um negócio for sincronizado a partir da Salesforce enquanto a sincronização da empresa é feita off o registo da empresa não será associado ao registo do negócio. Se a sincronização da empresa for activada depois da sincronização de oportunidade ser activada, a associação de contas da Salesforce será retirada da oportunidade .

Na sua conta HubSpot, clique no ícone de < configurações< < settings icon< na barra de navegação superior. No menu da barra lateral esquerda, acesse < Integrações< > < Apps conectados< . Clique em Salesforce e, em seguida, na guia Negócios . Clique para ativar o botão Sincronizar negócios . Observação: a configuração de sincronização deve ser ativada antes de importar oportunidades do Salesforce, caso contrário, os registros de negócios não serão criados no HubSpot.

A diferença entre o construtor de relatórios personalizados e outros tipos de relatórios da HubSpot é que você pode exibir dados de atividades de marketing e vendas, além de objetos. Por exemplo, você pode criar um relatório para medir como as contas-alvo estão se envolvendo com seu site. Para criar relatórios com o construtor de relatórios personalizados, o usuário deve ter Criar/possuir e Editar permissões de relatório . Criar um relatório A criação de um relatório no construtor de relatório personalizado pode ser dividida nas seguintes etapas: Selecionar as fontes de dados do relatório: selecione os tipos de dados do HubSpot que o relatório incluirá.

As dimensões podem ser qualquer tipo de dados (incluindo datas, números, booleanos e strings). Este tipo de campo só pode ser adicionado ao eixo X e ao slot Dividir por . Medidas: campos com um método de agregação definido, exibidos como verde. As medidas são normalmente valores numéricos ou quantitativos, como o número de negócios associados. Este tipo de campo somente pode ser adicionado ao eixo Y. Você pode adicionar até 12 medições a um relatório. A definição de um tipo de agregação em um campo pode ser útil se você quiser retornar os dados do campo de uma forma específica, como uma soma ou uma média. Por exemplo, você pode querer ver a receita de seus negócios como uma soma para cada tipo de negócio para entender quais tipos resultam em maior receita. Saiba mais sobre os métodos de agregação . Observação: o método de agregação de medidas padrão, como a Contagem de negócios , é definido para Contagem distinta e não pode ser ajustado.

Observação: Para garantir a consistência para todos os usuários da conta, os filtros baseados em datas, como Este mês , usam o fuso horário da conta. No entanto, os valores das propriedades de data padrão do HubSpot são exibidos em relação ao seu fuso horário local. Isso pode levar a valores de relatório inesperados, dependendo da sua localização. Por exemplo, se você estiver localizado em Boston enquanto outro membro da equipe estiver em São Francisco, ambos verão os mesmos negócios em um relatório de negócio personalizado. No entanto, ao detalhar o relatório, você poderá ver datas de criação ligeiramente diferentes para os negócios incluídos. O filtro Esta semana começa em uma segunda-feira e termina em um domingo.

Cumulativo: para relatórios de gráficos de linha e de área com valores de data ou hora no eixo X, represente valores cumulativamente em todo o eixo X Posição da legenda: por padrão, a legenda do gráfico será exibida na parte superior para indicar os dados por valor e cor. Para alterar a posição da legenda, clique no menu suspenso e, em seguida, selecione uma posição . Máx.: o valor máximo exibido pelo eixo de um gráfico. Essa configuração controla o zoom na visualização. Por exemplo, um valor de 100 em um gráfico de barras verticais definirá o eixo Y para exibir até um valor de 100 Essa configuração não filtra os dados do relatório e é usada apenas para fins de exibição. Quando usada com uma escala de eixo logarítmica, o construtor de relatórios arredondará esse valor para o incremento mais próximo com base nessa escala. Mín.: o valor mínimo exibido pelo eixo de um gráfico. Essa configuração controla o zoom na visualização. Por exemplo, um valor de 50 em um gráfico de barras verticais definirá o eixo Y para começar com um valor de 50. Essa configuração não filtra os dados do relatório e é usada apenas para fins de exibição. Meta mensal: insira um número para adicionar uma linha de meta ao gráfico. A meta mensal somente pode ser usada na visualização XY (por exemplo, gráfico de barras verticais, área ou linhas) quando uma propriedade baseada em data for usada no eixo x.

2574,Sync Salesforce opportunities to HubSpot,"Learn more about how the Salesforce integration syncs opportunities in Salesforce with deals in HubSpot. Please note: t he number of pipelines you can sync depends on your Sales Hub subscription. Learn more about your pipeline sync limits in the Deals pipelines section . Before you begin To ensure the deal's associations are synced correctly, follow the below steps before enabling opportunity sync: The integration user must have either Modify all data or Modify metadata through metadata API functions permissions in Salesforce. To ensure that companies and deals are associated correctly when they sync from Salesforce, company sync must be turned on for the Salesforce integration and a Salesforce account import must be completed. If a deal is synced from Salesforce while company sync is turned off , the company record will not be associated to the deal record. If company sync is turned on after opportunity sync is turned on, the Salesforce account association will be removed from the opportunity. Turn on opportunity sync To begin syncing deals and opportunities, turn on the Sync Deals setting. In your HubSpot account, click the settings settings icon in the top navigation bar. In the left sidebar menu, navigate to Integrations > Connected Apps . Click Salesforce , then click the Deals tab. Click to toggle the Sync Deals switch on. Please note: the sync setting must be enabled before importing Salesforce opportunities, otherwise deal records will not be created in HubSpot. Once the sync is turned on, each opportunity record in Salesforce will be synced to their corresponding pipeline in HubSpot once they fulfill a sync trigger . The pipeline will be named Salesforce - [record type ID in Salesforce] . If you only have one pipeline created in your Salesforce account it will be named Salesforce - Default Pipeline in HubSpot. You can stop a deal from syncing as an opportunity, or vice-versa by moving the deal into a pipeline that is not synced. If you delete a Salesforce opportunity that is syncing with a HubSpot deal, the HubSpot deal will be deleted. However, if you delete a HubSpot deal, the corresponding Salesforce opportunity will not be deleted. How Salesforce opportunities sync to HubSpot Any pre-existing opportunities will be synced to HubSpot in two ways: When they are manually imported to HubSpot. When edits are made to the opportunities record in Salesforce, depending on your sync rules and field mappings . If your opportunity is associated with Salesforce contact records, you can also associate the synced deal to the corresponding contacts in HubSpot. For this to occur, ensure the contact record in Salesforce is associated with the opportunity as an OpportunityContactRole . The integration will update the contact’s Lifecycle stage property, as well as five other contact properties from the most recently created opportunity: Associated deals First deal created date Recent deal close date Recent deal amount Total revenue These fields can be used to segment lists, filter your contacts, or create custom reports. Please note: the Recent deal amount property is populated by the most recently created deal associated with the contact, not the most recently closed deal.
