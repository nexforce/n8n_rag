2710,Merge records,"In your HubSpot account , you can merge two records of the same object into one record. For example, if two company records were created for HubSpot , you can merge one into the other, resulting in one company record with activities and associations from both records. Before you get started Prior to merging records, you should understand how your record data will be affected. The expected behavior for merging records differs based on which object’s records you’re merging. Learn more about what happens to your data for each type of merge. It's also important to note that once you've merged two records, it is not possible to unmerge them. For contacts and companies, you can create a new record with the merged email addresses or domain names . For all objects, you can use the Merged [record] IDs property to view previously merged records . Merge records To merge records in your account: Navigate to your records: Contacts : In your HubSpot account, navigate to CRM > Contacts . Companies : In your HubSpot account, navigate to CRM > Companies . Deals : In your HubSpot account, navigate to CRM > Deals . Tickets : In your HubSpot account, navigate to CRM > Tickets . Appointments (if activated ): In your HubSpot account, navigate to CRM > Appointments . Courses (if activated ): In your HubSpot account, navigate to CRM > Courses . Listings (if activated ): In your HubSpot account, navigate to CRM > Listings . Services (if activated ): In your HubSpot account, navigate to CRM > Services . Custom objects : In your HubSpot account, navigate to CRM , then select the custom object . Click the name of the record that will be considered your primary record . In the left panel, click the Actions dropdown menu, then select Merge . In the dialog box, click the dropdown menu , then search for and select the record to merge into the primary record. This is considered your secondary record . If your account has access to the Property Control in Record Merges beta , you can choose which property values to keep in the resulting merged record. To choose which property values are retained in the resulting record, click the values you want to keep. By default, the primary record's properties are selected since they are generally kept following a merge . To change which properties are displayed when comparing the records, click Set properties to review . Click Apply once you've selected the properties. Click Merge . Please note: if you merge records while on a call, the call will be automatically disconnected. You'll be notified that the merge is in progress. It can take up to 30 minutes for all of the records’ activities to sync. If your merge fails, it may be due to a merge limit. You cannot merge records if they've been included in a combined total of 250+ merges (e.g, Contact A and Contact B have been involved in 130 merges each). Once this limit is reached, you need to either create a new record or manually edit the record instead of merging. There are also certain scenarios where you will not be able to merge companies. View records that have been merged You can use the Merged [record] IDs properties to view which records were previously involved in a merge. You can access this property on an individual record, or filter all of your records based on if they have a value for the property. To view the property on an individual record: Navigate to your records . Click the name of a record. In the left panel, scroll to the bottom of the About this [record] section, then click View all properties . In the search bar, enter Merged . If the record was involved in a merge, the Merged [record] IDs property will contain the Record ID values of all records previously merged into that record. To view all records of a specific object that were involved in a merge: Navigate to your records . Above the table, click All filters . In the right panel, in the search bar, enter Merged , then select Merged [record] IDs. Select is known . Click Apply filter , then click the X in the top right to close the panel. The view will contain only records that have been included in a merge. For these records, the property will contain the Record ID values of all records previously merged into that record. Learn more about filtering your records . What happens when I merge records? Please note: as of January 14, 2025, behavior for contact and company merges has changed to be more consistent with other objects. The merge logic outlined below explains the latest behavior. Review this changelog for more information about the update. When you merge records, the following will occur by default: Record ID : a new unique Record ID is created for the resulting merged record. The original Record ID values will still point to the new merged record, so searching records with the original Record ID values will return the new one. Create Date : the value for the oldest record is maintained. Property values : in general, the primary record's property values are prioritized, which means the merged record's values will reflect those from the primary record. Exceptions include Record ID , Create date , and certain contact properties and company properties . If your account has access to the Property Control in Record Merges beta , you can choose which property values to keep in the resulting merged record. Activities : all timeline activities of both records included in the merge will appear on the new record. Associations : all associated records of both records included in the merge will appear on the new record. For company associations with the Primary label , the Primary company from the primary merge record is prioritized. The secondary record's Primary association will still appear on the new record, but the Primary label will be removed. List membership : the secondary record is removed from all static lists. Active list memberships may change as a result of data changes from the merge. Form submissions (contacts only): all cookies (HubSpot usertokens) that were associated with either contact will be merged into the primary contact and the secondary contact's email address is permanently associated with the primary contact. If the secondary contact submits a form on a device from which they previously submitted, the submission data is deduplicated based on usertoken and is associated with the primary contact. If the contact submits a form from a new device using the email address from the secondary contact record, this submission will be reflected on the primary contact's record. Workflow enrollment ( Professional and Enterprise only): the records included in the merge will be unenrolled from all workflows. The resulting record will not automatically enroll in any workflows as a result of data changes that happened during the merge, unless you've allowed contact enrollment from merges . Moving forward, the resulting record can be enrolled in workflows due to property changes or actions unrelated to the merge. Playbooks ( Sales Hub or Service Hub Professional and Enterprise only): logged playbooks on both records included in the merge will appear on the new record. Drafted playbooks on either record will not be kept. Salesforce Sync ( Professional and Enterprise only): Contacts : only the primary contact will continue to sync to the Salesforce record. If the secondary contact was syncing to Salesforce, that record in Salesforce will no longer sync to HubSpot because the record no longer exists. Companies : if you've enabled the HubSpot Salesforce integration , you will not be able to merge companies. Learn more about managing duplicate companies from Salesforce . Depending on the object the records you’ve merged belong to, there is some unique merge logic. Below, review exceptions or special behavior for applicable objects. Company merge exceptions The following company properties are exceptions to the default merge logic : Company domain name: while the domain name of the primary company is maintained as the primary domain, the secondary company’s domain name will be added as a secondary domain name . If the primary company does not have a domain name prior to merging, the secondary company’s domain value will be selected. Lifecycle stage : the stage furthest down the funnel is maintained. For example, if one company is a Lead and the other is a Customer , the merged company will have a lifecycle stage of Customer . Analytics properties : these properties are re-synced and you will see the total number of page views and visits for both companies combined. Analytics - Original Traffic Source : the oldest value for the original traffic source property is kept, unless the source has been manually updated. In that case, the manually updated value will remain. There are also scenarios where company merges are not possible or will fail: A company is currently a parent or child company . If the parent-child relationship contains a loop, the merge may fail. If you've enabled the HubSpot Salesforce integration , you will not be able to merge companies. To clean up duplicate records in HubSpot while the integration is installed, you can delete the extra duplicate companies in HubSpot using the duplicates management tool . Ensure that you keep the company in HubSpot that syncs to the primary account in Salesforce. If you have duplicate companies syncing from Salesforce, you can either merge the accounts or delete the extra duplicate accounts in Salesforce. If your account has turned on the HubSpot setting to automatically create and associate companies with contacts, it is also recommended to turn off this setting to avoid future duplicates. Contact merge exceptions The following contact properties are exceptions to the default merge logic : Email : while the email address of the primary contact is maintained as the primary email address, the secondary contact's email address will be added as a secondary email address. Lifecycle Stage : the stage furthest down the funnel is maintained. For example, if one contact is a Lead and the other is a Customer , the merged contact will have a lifecycle stage of Customer . Number of Conversions and Number of Unique Forms Submitted: these are added together with the values for each contact. For example, if the primary contact has submitted three forms and the secondary contact has submitted two forms, the value for Number of Forms Submitted will be five. Marketing contact status : if your account has marketing contacts, the most marketable status is kept. For example, if one contact is set as Marketing and the other as Non-marketing , the merged contact will be set as Marketing . Analytics properties : these properties are re-synced and you'll see the total number of page views for both contacts combined. Analytics - Original Traffic Source : the oldest value for the original traffic source property is kept, unless the source has been manually updated. In that case, the manually updated value will remain. Legal basis : the most recent values from both contact records are kept. For workflow enrollments ( Professional and Enterprise only), by default, the primary contact will not automatically enroll in any workflows as a result of data changes that happen during the merge. However, you can choose to allow merged contacts to enroll at the time of the merge in your workflow settings. Can I unmerge records? It is not possible to unmerge records. You can use the Merged [record] IDs properties to view which records were previously merged into an existing record. For contacts and companies, you can use the resulting additional email or domain name to create a new record. If a merged contact has multiple emails, delete the additional email address in your merged contact and create a new contact with that email address: In your HubSpot account, navigate to CRM > Contacts . Click on the name of the contact. In the About this contact section, hover over the Email property and click the edit pencil icon . Next to the additional email, click Delete . In the dialog box, click Delete email to confirm. Create a new contact with the deleted email address. If a merged company has multiple domains, you can delete the additional company domain in the merged company record and create a new company with that company domain name: In your HubSpot account, navigate to CRM > Companies . Click the name of the company. In the About this company section, hover over the Company domain name property and click the edit pencil icon . Next to the additional domain, click the Actions dropdown menu, then select Delete . At the bottom of the screen, click Save . Create a new company with the deleted company domain name.

2712,Determinar a probabilidade de fechamento com a pontuação de leads prevista,"Utilizando algoritmos preditivos de aprendizagem de máquina, a HubSpot analisa os seus clientes para determinar a probabilidade de os contatos abertos se transformarem em clientes no prazo de 90 dias. Os indicadores Probabilidade de fechar e Prioridade dos contactos Propriedades dos contactos ajudam-no a analisar e segmentar os seus contactos com base neste modelo preditivo de pontuação de leads. Saiba mais sobre estas propriedades: Probabilidade de fechar: uma pontuação que representa a probabilidade percentual de um contato se transformar em cliente nos próximos 90 dias, com base em determinadas propriedades e atividades do contato . Por exemplo, os contatos com um valor de probabilidade de fechar negócio igual a 22 têm 22% de chance de se tornarem clientes nos próximos 90 dias. Prioridade dos contatos: uma classificação dos contatos distribuída uniformemente por categorias com base nas pontuações de Probabilidade de fechar . As opções para a propriedade são Muito alta , Alta , Média , Baixa , e Negócio fechado , onde Muito alta é a mais provável de fechar e Baixa é a menos provável de fechar . Os contatos são agrupados com base na seguinte lógica: Cada categoria contém 25% dos seus contatos com base na pontuação de Probabilidade de fechar (ou seja, os contatos com pontuações nos 25% superiores são definidos como Muito alta; os contatos com pontuações nos 25% inferiores são definidos como Baixa etc.). Como as categorias são grupos relativos, a variação entre as pontuações em cada nível pode mudar ao longo do tempo. Se o valor da fase do ciclo de vida de um contacto estiver definido como Cliente e tiverem um valor para a propriedade Data de fecho , a prioridade do contacto está definida como Fechado ganhou. Para garantir que este valor é definido automaticamente, recomenda-se que associe os seus contactos a negócios, que, quando fechados, actualizarão automaticamente estas propriedades de contacto. As propriedades de pontuação de leads são definidas automaticamente pelo HubSpot e não podem ser editadas. Para definir valores para estas propriedades, o HubSpot analisa os seguintes dados: Informações analíticas e conversão , incluindo: Número de exibições de página Número médio de exibições de páginas Número de visitas ao site Número de cliques no Facebook, LinkedIn e X Dias desde a última visita ou clique Número de mensagens de correio eletrónico entregues ou devolvidas Assinaturas de e-mail que o contato optou por não receber Número do remetente do correio eletrónico aberturas, cliques e resposta mais recente Número de e-mails enviados desde a última atividade do contato Número de conversões ou conversões únicas (por exemplo, envios de formulários) Interações e valores de propriedade no HubSpot CRM, incluindo: Número de observações registradas Dias desde a última vez que o contato agendou uma reunião Dias desde o último contato Dias até à próxima atividade Se o contato tem ou não um valor de Número de telefone ou Número de celular Dias desde que o contato foi criado Dias desde a última atualização do contato Se o e-mail do contato é ou não é um domínio de e-mail gratuito (por exemplo, Gmail) O valor do contato para a propriedade Fase do ciclo de vida . Se o valor da fase do ciclo de vida de um contato for Cliente , o valor Probabilidade de fechar será apagado e o valor Prioridade do contato será definido como Negócio fechado . Informações empresariais fornecidas por HubSpot Insights sobre a empresa associada do contacto, incluindo: As receitas da empresa As tecnologias utilizadas pela empresa Número de funcionários Informações firmográficas sobre sua empresa e a conta da HubSpot, incluindo: Número de contatos no seu HubSpot CRM Receita da sua empresa As tecnologias utilizadas pela sua empresa O setor em que a sua empresa opera Número de funcionários Observação: a HubSpot utiliza a aprendizagem de máquina de caixa preta para fornecer previsões. Com a aprendizagem de máquina de caixa preta, a entrada e as saídas do modelo são conhecidas, mas não se sabe como a entrada é transformada na saída. Para a pontuação de leads, isso significa que não é possível saber exatamente como cada entrada contribui para a pontuação de um contato. Em vez disso, o foco está na forma como o modelo prevê a probabilidade de os seus leads fecharem negócio.

2714,Criar e sincronizar eventos de conversão de anúncios com sua conta do Google Ads,"Depois de conectar sua conta do Google Ads , crie e atualize os eventos de conversão de anúncios para usar a Conversão otimizada para leads do Google, a fim de sincronizar as alterações da fase do ciclo de vida do CRM a partir do HubSpot. Isso permitirá que a rede de anúncios otimize a entrega dos seus anúncios quando um contato for atribuído na ferramenta de anúncios da HubSpot. Você também pode criar novos eventos otimizados ou melhorar os eventos existentes do Google com envios de formulário do HubSpot. Isso usa as conversões otimizadas do Google, que permitem que a rede de anúncios otimize a exibição dos seus anúncios por meio de medições de conversão precisas. Você também pode criar e sincronizar eventos de conversão de anúncios com sua conta do LinkedIn Ads ou do Facebook Ads . Antes de começar Antes de começar a usar os eventos de conversão de anúncios, observe o seguinte: Ao criar um evento de conversão de anúncio de fase do ciclo de vida: Apenas as alterações na fase do ciclo de vida que ocorrem depois de criar o evento de conversão no HubSpot serão contabilizadas e usadas para otimizar a entrega dos seus anúncios. Para sincronizar os dados do ciclo de vida de um contato do Google, a configuração Incluído nas metas em nível de conta deve ser definida como Sim para cada evento de anúncio. Depois de criar um evento de conversão no HubSpot, os dados de fase do ciclo de vida dos contatos que se engajarem com seus anúncios serão sincronizados com sua conta do Google Ads. Para sincronizar, o contato deve ter pelo menos um dos seguintes: Um valor preenchido para a propriedade de contato ID de clique no anúncio do Google , que representa seu Google Click Identifier (GCLID) . Dados de contato, como endereço de e-mail, número de telefone ou endereço devem ser compartilhados com o Google. Se existirem vários eventos criados na sua conta para diferentes fases de ciclo de vida e um único contato passar por cada fase, será sincronizado um evento para cada alteração de fase de ciclo de vida. Por exemplo, se existirem eventos de conversão de alteração de fase criados para as fases de ciclo de vida do cliente e do lead e um contato passar por ambas as fases, ocorrerá uma sincronização com cada um dos eventos correspondentes. Para eventos de conversão de anúncios de envio de formulário, se você estiver usando uma conta do Google Ads Manager ou My Client Centre (MCC) , não poderá usar as conversões otimizadas do Google para sincronizá-los. Embora você possa criar o evento no HubSpot, os dados do formulário não serão sincronizados. Criar eventos de conversão de anúncios de fase do ciclo de vida O número de eventos de conversão de anúncios de fase do ciclo de vida que você pode criar depende da sua assinatura da HubSpot. Revise o Catálogo de produtos e serviços da HubSpot para obter os preços mais atualizados e informações sobre pacotes. Se você tiver uma assinatura do Marketing Hub Professional , poderá criar até 50 eventos de conversão de anúncios de fase do ciclo de vida. Se você tiver uma assinatura do Marketing Hub Enterprise , poderá criar até 100 eventos de conversão de anúncios de fase do ciclo de vida. Para criar um evento de conversão de anúncios de fase do ciclo de vida usando a Conversão otimizada para leads do Google: Na sua conta da HubSpot, navegue até Marketing > Anúncios . No canto superior direito, clique em Criar . Depois, selecione Eventos . No painel direito, personalize os detalhes do seu evento: Rede de anúncios: a rede de anúncios para a qual o evento se destina. Selecione Google para criar um evento de conversão de anúncios para a sua conta do Google Ads. Conta de anúncios: a conta do Google Ads com a qual deseja sincronizar o evento. Gatilho de evento: selecione o botão de opção Alteração da fase do ciclo de vida . Fase do ciclo de vida: a fase do ciclo de vida do HubSpot especificada para o evento. Se quiser associar a fase do ciclo de vida do HubSpot a uma fase diferente na sua conta de anúncios: Clique no menu suspenso abaixo da fase do ciclo de vida da HubSpot. Em seguida, selecione a fase do ciclo de vida da rede de anúncios correspondente. Valor: especifique um valor monetário para seu evento. Para definir o valor do evento para o valor do negócio associado, selecione Usar o valor do negócio . O valor ponderado do último negócio associado será utilizado para este valor.
