2801,Provision HubSpot users with SCIM through Google,"Provisioning users through SCIM (the System for Cross-domain Identity Management) provides a secure and automated way to create and manage HubSpot users through Google. Below, learn how to set up user provisioning through Google. Prerequisites Single sign-on (SSO) must be enabled in your HubSpot account. It's recommended to set up user permission sets in HubSpot based on your team's Google custom attribute mapping before setting up SCIM. To set user permissions, you must create permission sets in HubSpot . Google can then assign permissions to a user if their mapped custom attribute in Google matches the name of the HubSpot permission set. For example, the Google custom attribute named “HubSpot Roles” is configured to map to the ""HubSpot Roles"" attribute. To assign paid seats for users set up with SCIM, you must first purchase the seats in HubSpot , then create a permission set with a paid seat. In Google, set the user's custom attribute to be the same as the permission set. To verify your domain, you will need to update your DNS records. Ensure you have the login details for your DNS provider and have access to the TXT records. Set up SCIM provisioning To set up SCIM user provisioning through Google, follow Google's instructions for setting up auto-provisioning. Verify your domain After adding the HubSpot app through Google, you'll need to verify your domain in HubSpot by updating your DNS records. In your HubSpot account, click the settings settings icon in the top navigation bar. In the left sidebar menu, navigate to Integrations > Connected Apps . In the All apps tab, click Google SCIM . Enter your users’ email sending domain in the Domain field. Click Save . Click Verify it now . In the dialog box, click Next . Copy the value in the Value column. You’ll use this value when creating a new TXT record in your DNS provider Log in to your DNS provider account. Create a new TXT record for the domain you’re verifying. Paste the value copied from HubSpot into the Value/Points To/Target field. After you've created the TXT record, navigate back to HubSpot, then click Next . Once the DNS changes propagate, the domain will be verified. Please note: it can take up to 48 hours for the DNS changes to propagate and reflect in HubSpot. Sync Google roles with HubSpot permission sets To set user permissions, you must create permission sets in HubSpot. Google can then assign permissions to a user if their Role in Google matches the exact name of the HubSpot permission set, including all spaces and caps. To give Google access to assign permission sets to users: In your HubSpot account, click the settings settings icon in the top navigation bar. In the left sidebar menu, click Integrations > Connected Apps . Under All apps , click Google SCIM . Toggle Permission Set Management on. Disable SCIM provisioning Follow Google’s instructions to disable auto-provisioning. Frequently Asked Questions Can users created through SCIM be edited in HubSpot? Only user permissions can be edited in HubSpot, and only if permission set management is not configured. All other user information, including user name and email address, can only be updated through your identity provider. Why is my assigned Google role not showing up on my user permission set in HubSpot? You must enable Permission set management in HubSpot to have Google roles sync with HubSpot permission sets. The permission set name in HubSpot must match the exact Role name in Google, including all spaces and caps. Can Google assign users to teams? No. However, after the user is added to HubSpot, you can update their team manually in HubSpot . What happens if I delete a SCIM user in HubSpot or Google? Deleting a user in HubSpot will not delete the user in Google. However, if you remove a user's access to HubSpot from Google, or deactivate their account in Google, the user will be deleted in HubSpot. Adding a user to HubSpot will not add the user to Google. What happens to existing users in my HubSpot account when I connect Google? After setting up SCIM through Google, any existing HubSpot users that match users in Google will automatically be converted to SCIM users. HubSpot will attempt to assign the user a permission set based on their custom attribute if the attribute is mapped to HubSpot Roles in Google. If the user does not have a role in Google that matches a permission set in HubSpot, the user will have only minimal permissions in HubSpot. I'm seeing the error ""This domain couldn't be verified"". How do I fix this? If you are seeing this error, ensure your domain has been entered correctly with no spelling mistakes. Also, check that you have copied the correct value for the TXT record from the Configuration step in HubSpot into your DNS provider.

2805,Create and sync ad conversion events with your Google Ads account,"After connecting your Google Ads account , create and update ad conversion events to use Google's Enhanced Conversion for Leads to sync your CRM lifecycle stage changes from HubSpot. This will allow the ad network to optimize the delivery of your ads when a contact has been attributed in the HubSpot Ads tool. You can also create new enhanced events or enhance your existing Google events with form submissions from HubSpot. This uses Google's enhanced conversions , which allows the ad network to optimize the delivery of your ads through accurate conversion measurement. You can also create and sync ad conversion events with your LinkedIn Ads account or Facebook Ads account . Before you get started Before getting started with ad conversion events, do note the following: When creating a lifecycle stage ad conversion event: Only lifecycle stage changes that occur after creating the conversion event in HubSpot will be counted and used to optimize the delivery of your ads. To sync contact lifecycle data from Google, the Included in account-level goals setting must be set to Yes for each ad event. After creating a conversion event in HubSpot, lifecycle stage data from contacts who engage with your ads will be synced with your Google Ads account. In order to sync, the contact must have at least one of the following: A value populated for the Google ad click id contact property, which represents their Google Click Identifier (GCLID) . Contact data such as email address, phone number, or address must be shared with Google. If there are multiple events created in your account for different lifecycle stages, and a single contact moves through each stage, an event will sync for each lifecycle stage change. For example, if there are lifecycle stage change conversion events created for the lead and customer lifecycle stages , and a contact goes through both these stages, there will be a sync to each of the corresponding events. For form submission ad conversion events, If you're using a Google Ads Manager account or My Client Centre (MCC) , you cannot use Google's enhanced conversions to sync these conversion events. While you will be able to create the event in HubSpot, the form data will not sync.

Setting the gclid of the gclid_date_time_pair is optional. user_agent is optional but recommended. This should match the user agent of the request that sent the original conversion so the conversion and its enhancement are either both attributed as same-device or both attributed as cross-device. restatement_value with adjusted_value and currency_code are optional but recommended. In addition, you must upload the enhancement adjustment within 24 hours of the original conversion for the order_id . To avoid errors due to differences in clock times, upload the adjustment no later than several minutes before the end of the 24-hour period.

2811,Use HubSpot's integration with GoToWebinar,"The GoToWebinar integration is designed to help you reduce the time it takes for you to create, promote, and deliver quality webinars. Before you get started Before installing the GoToWebinar integration, please note the following: To connect GoToWebinar to HubSpot, you must be either a super admin or have App Marketplace Access permissions. The GoToWebinar integration can only be connected to one GoToWebinar account. You can use the Zapier integration to set up a simple integration with a second GoToWebinar account. Install the GoToWebinar integration To install the GoToWebinar integration: In your HubSpot account, click the settings settings icon in the top navigation bar. In the left sidebar menu, navigate to Integrations > Connected Apps . In the upper right, click Visit App Marketplace . Search for the GoToWebinar integration, and select GoToWebinar in the results. In the top right, click Connect app . Enter your GoToWebinar credentials and click Sign in . After logging in to GoToWebinar, your accounts will automatically be connected and you will be redirected back to the Connected apps page. To disconnect your HubSpot and GoToWebinar accounts: In your HubSpot account, click the settings settings icon in the top navigation bar. In the left sidebar menu, navigate to Integrations > Connected Apps . To the right of GoToWebinar , click More , then select Uninstall . Turn on your webinar From your GoToWebinar integration page, you can manually sync past webinars and enable auto-syncing for all new webinars. Please note the following: The connecting user needs to be the co-organizer of any webinar in order for the webinar to be available for syncing. After turning on a sync, it can take between 1 minute and 2 hours or more, depending on the amount of information queued to sync. The Sync status column will display the current status of the sync for each webinar. To turn on a webinar: In your HubSpot account, click the settings settings icon in the top navigation bar. In the left sidebar menu, navigate to Integrations > Connected Apps . Search for and click on the GoToWebinar app. The dashboard will show all upcoming and past webinars from the connected accounts. To manually sync a webinar, select the checkbox in the Sync column. HubSpot will then start importing data from GoToWebinar. By default, syncing will be turned off for all webinars created before the integration was set up. To enable auto-syncing for new webinars, select the Auto-sync data from future webinars checkbox . Set up a form for your webinar When you're ready to begin collecting registrations for your upcoming webinar, you can do so using the following methods: Register contacts using a GoToWebinar registration page . Register contacts using a HubSpot form embedded using a default form module, on a HubSpot page. Register contacts through a HubSpot form embedded on an external page. Register contacts using a HubSpot form embedded using a custom module linked to a webinar, on a HubSpot page. If you are using a HubSpot form, please note the following: The GoToWebinar registration page and your HubSpot landing page are not linked. Using a HubSpot landing page with a HubSpot form means that you do not need to use the GoToWebinar registration page. When linking a form on a HubSpot page or a form embed code to GoToWebinar, the integration will not automatically pull in any fields from the GoToWebinar registration page. To collect similar information, it is recommended to recreate the questions on your GoToWebinar registration page in the HubSpot form. When setting up your form, take note of which form fields can be used to pass information between HubSpot and GoToWebinar. In order for the GoToWebinar integration with HubSpot to successfully register a contact for a webinar in your GoToWebinar account, the following must be set as required fields, and must be the only required fields in the form: First name Last name Email Use a form on a HubSpot landing page You can create forms in HubSpot that automatically register contacts for a webinar created in GoToWebinar upon submission. When visitors submit the form, they will be sent to GoToWebinar and appear as a registrant in your registrant list. Registrant data will be added to HubSpot in real time. Attendee data will be added to HubSpot 15 minutes after your webinar is over. To register contacts, you will need to create a landing page, then associate your form with a webinar: In the landing page editor, click the form module . In the left panel, click to expand the Form automation section. Click the GoToWebinar registration dropdown menu and select a webinar . Only upcoming webinars will be listed as an option in the dropdown menu. Webinars that have already taken place will not be listed. After setting up your page, click Publish . Learn more about setting up forms in HubSpot pages . Embed a HubSpot form on an external page You can also embed a HubSpot form on an external page to register visitors for a webinar by modifying the form's embed code to include the GoToWebinar webinar key: Retrieve your GoToWebinar webinar key: From your GoToWebinar account, navigate to your webinar event details page . In the URL, copy the webinar key . In your HubSpot account, navigate to Marketing > Forms . Hover over an existing form and click Actions , then select Share . Or, create a new form . Click Copy to copy the embed code from your form. When adding the embed code to your external site, manually edit the form code to include a goToWebinarWebinarKey : Add a comma after formID. Add a goToWebinarWebinarKey identifier with the webinar key for your webinar. Create a form module in custom module You can create a custom module to use with the GoToWebinar integration. To use the GoToWebinar integration in your custom form module you will need to add gotowebinar_webinar_key=' to your custom module. Learn more about creating a form module in a custom module . Segment and follow up with registrants and attendees As contacts begin registering for your webinars, you can segment them based on their webinar activity in the lists tool using the GoToWebinar integration filter. Please note: the above segmentation options are not available in Marketing Hub Starter accounts. You can also incorporate webinar data into your HubSpot score criteria to make sure that your HubSpot score is accurate and up to date. Once you've segmented your contacts, send emails to your contacts based on their engagement with your webinar. In addition to any promotional email you create to encourage registration, here are a few suggestions: Reminder emails in advance of the webinar Thank you emails for those who attended Sorry we missed you emails for those who registered but didn't attend Request to schedule a demo emails for those who attended and have a high lead score The integration does not have an automated mechanism for inserting personalized links from GoToWebinar within HubSpot emails. Sync webinar data to Salesforce If you have the HubSpot-Salesforce integration installed , webinar activity will automatically pass to Salesforce in the HubSpot Visualforce window. To send more specialized messaging to your sales reps, you can pass data to Salesforce in the form of tasks in a workflow. For example, if you want to alert a sales rep every time one of their leads attends a webinar, you can create a workflow that sends a task to Salesforce . The task will appear on the Salesforce lead/contact record in the Activity History section. If you're using the Salesforce integration , it's important to change the field mapping between the email field in HubSpot and Salesforce to Use most recent value . This is relevant because data is pulled from GoToWebinar into HubSpot based on email address, so if the email address in HubSpot has changed between the time a contact registers and when they attend the webinar, HubSpot will not be able to match the attendance data with the new email address. Add contacts to a GoToWebinar using workflows ( Professional and Enterprise only) You can enroll and register contacts automatically for your GoToWebinar using workflows. Please note: to enroll contacts in your GoToWebinar event, the sync for the event must be switched on in your integration settings. In your HubSpot account, navigate to Automations > Workflows . Select an existing Contact-based workflow or create a new Contact-based workflow . Edit your enrollment triggers . Click the plus icon + to add a workflow action. In the left panel, in the Connected apps section, click to expand the GoToWebinar section. Click the Add contact to webinar action. Click the Webinar dropdown menu to select your GoToWebinar event. Then, click Save . Turn on your workflow . When a contact is enrolled in the workflow, a confirmation email, that includes the webinar link, will be sent to their primary email address. Use marketing events with GoToWebinar (BETA) HubSpot can aggregate marketing events from the GoToWebinar integration to provide you with a consistent overview of your marketing events.

2812,Assign ownership of records,"To assign records to HubSpot users, you can use the [Object] o wner property for contacts, companies, deals, tickets, and custom object records. Each record can have one selected owner using the default property, but you can create custom user field type properties to select additional users related to the record. A user must have access to an object to be assigned as a record owner (e.g., access to Contacts , to be the owner of a contact record). Automatic owner assignment There are certain scenarios where owners will be automatically set: If a user manually creates a record, that user will be automatically set as the record's owner, unless they select a different owner during creation. If you've turned on the Assign company owner to contact by default setting in your HubSpot account, contacts and their primary company will be automatically assigned to the same owner. Learn more about how the setting works . If a user sends a one-to-one email to an unowned contact, that user will automatically be assigned as the contact owner. If an unowned contact books a meeting on a user's scheduling page , that user will automatically be assigned as the contact owner. If a contact already has an owner and they book a meeting with a different user, the existing owner will not be replaced. If you have the Salesforce integration enabled, your contact, company, and deal owner assignments will default to what is specified in Salesforce. Assign record owners on an object index page You can assign owners to records in bulk on each object index page. Navigate to your records: Contacts: In your HubSpot account, navigate to CRM > Contacts . Companies: In your HubSpot account, navigate to CRM > Companies . Deals: In your HubSpot account, navigate to CRM > Deals . Tickets: In your HubSpot account, navigate to CRM > Tickets . Custom objects: In your HubSpot account, navigate to CRM , then select the custom object . Select the checkboxes next to the records you want to assign. At the top of the table or board, click Assign . In the dialog box, click the [Object] owner dropdown menu and select an owner . Click Update . Assign an owner on a record Navigate to your records: Contacts: In your HubSpot account, navigate to CRM > Contacts . Companies: In your HubSpot account, navigate to CRM > Companies . Deals: In your HubSpot account, navigate to CRM > Deals . Tickets: In your HubSpot account, navigate to CRM > Tickets . Custom objects: In your HubSpot account, navigate to CRM , then select the custom object . Click the name of a record. In the left panel, click View all properties . Search for [Object] owner. Hover over the property, click the dropdown menu , then select an owner . At the bottom of the screen, click Save . Assign owners via import You can also assign owners to new or existing records in bulk via import. To assign an owner to an object during the import: In your import file , include an [ Object] owner column and add the name or email address of the user to each row in that column. Import your file , and on the mapping page, map the column to the [Object] owner property. Please note: users who are assigned a record through import will not receive a notification that they were assigned a new object. Assign owners via workflows ( Professional and Enterprise only) Assign an owner to all enrolled records You can automatically assign ownership to enrolled records using the Set [object] property value action in workflow. Select to set the [Object] owner property, then select the user that you want to assign the enrolled objects to. For example, you can assign the North America sales person to records created via form submissions from the United States. To automatically assign ownership to your other owners, you can clone your workflow , change the enrollment triggers based on the assignment rules for each owner, and update the selected owner in the Set [object] property value action. You can also use branching logic to assign different owners to your objects based on different criteria. Rotate records between multiple owners ( Sales Hub and Service Hub Professional and Enterprise only) Paid users in Sales or Service Hub Professional and Enterprise accounts can also rotate assignment between multiple users using workflows. Ticket-based workflows require Service Hub Professional or Enterprise. The workflow will evenly distribute assignment to the specified owners through the Rotate record to owner action. Using this action, you can assign records with no owner or overwrite existing values to assign a new owner. Distribution of ownership for each rotate action is based on the assignment count for that particular action, not based on how many objects each user owns overall in your account. If you have multiple rotate actions in your workflow, each action will have a separate count. For example, if a Rotate [owner] action is set up for three owners: When the workflow is turned on, all three owners for this action will have an assignment count of zero. Since all three users have an equal assignment count, the first contact to reach this action will be randomly assigned to one of them. After the first contact is assigned, there will be one owner with one contact, and two owners with zero contacts. The next contact to go through the workflow will be assigned to one of the remaining two users that don't have any contacts yet. Once all three owners have been assigned one contact, that rotation order is maintained. (e.g. owner 2, owner 3, owner 1). If you add or remove owners from the action after your workflow has been turned on, the established rotation for that action will reset and the random assignment will start again. Learn more about the Rotate record to owner workflow action. CRM records",https://knowledge.hubspot.com/records/how-to-set-a-record-owner
