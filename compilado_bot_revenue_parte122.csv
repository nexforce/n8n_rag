3251,Predictable Revenue,"Lack of money is a common excuse for not being creative. You, your CEO, your managers or employees can make all kinds of
validsounding excuses about why a new idea, business or project isn’t moving
forward: you need more time, or more marketing money, or your people aren’t
motivated, or you need funding, etc. There is ALWAYS a way to move forward, even without money. None of these are real obstacles to moving forward to get what you want,
whether it’s more growth, predictable sales revenue, starting your own company,
or turning your employees into miniCEOs. There is ALWAYS a way to move
forward, even without money. Back to money and marketing budgets: Money can help, but you don’t need a lot
of marketing money in order to ramp up sales. At Salesforce.com we spent zero dollars in marketing to create the outbound
sales team and produce $100 million in results. The initial investment? One
person’s salary. In case you’re thinking, “Easy for you to say. Results came easy for you.",
3252,Predictable Revenue,"You
were a part of Salesforce.com. Your company was famous. You didn’t need
budget, you had branding. You had all kinds of support. What if I want to
increase sales but don’t have a big brand or big budget?”
True, Salesforce.com was always very well-known in the Bay Area and in the
startup world. But when we began building the outbound sales team and
targeting the “Fortune 5000” in 2003, very few large companies outside of
California had heard of Salesforce.com. Nine out of ten times when we called a
prospect, they asked something along the lines of, “Do you do outsourced sales
for customers? Or do sales recruiting?”
Shelly Davenport, my manager at the time, and I had an interesting design
challenge: to create an outbound sales process that would succeed without any
money or marketing support and at a company that was pretty much unknown in
the Fortune 2000 market we were growing into at the time.",
3253,Predictable Revenue,"This was also just after the dot-com bust, and trust of anything “.com” was at an
all-time low. Also, software-as-a-service was NOT yet accepted by large companies as a
viable option. Gartner, a famous technology research firm, was still writing big
reports about how Salesforce.com was a great fit for small businesses but not for
larger companies. While Salesforce.com spent millions on general marketing, most of it only
reached small business decision makers. In starting our outbound sales team, we didn’t get a budget for my project
beyond my own compensation. In fact, looking back, if I had had a big budget or
a bunch of people to tell what to do, I wouldn’t have been forced to get so
creative in solving the problem of how to predictably generate new pipeline for
the sales organization. What We Did Have: 
1. A wholly committed person (me) who could dedicate their full attention to
the challenge (rather than giving it only 25% of my time);
2.",
3254,Predictable Revenue,"Two core tools: the Salesforce.com application and an online source for
lists of companies and contacts called OneSource (similar to Hoovers);
3. Freedom to experiment for three months as an internal entrepreneur or
“miniCEO”;
4. An optimistic attitude that saw this as an interesting challenge, and it
could be fun solving it;
5. A commitment to create something meaningful (in terms of sales) to
Salesforce.com. The point here is that when you’re low on resources, by having a clear objective
and looking at it as an interesting challenge, you can force yourself (and your
employees) to GET CREATIVE. Constraints often lead to more creativity from both yourself and your people. Don’t let so-called “reality” stop you! 2
Cold Calling 2.0 — Ramp Sales Fast Without
Cold Calls
Cold calling sucks! Isn’t there a better way? Yep, and here it is. The First Breakthroughs
I’ve gone back and forth a lot about the term “Cold Calling 2.0,” mostly because
it doesn’t involve any cold calling.",
3255,Predictable Revenue,"In fact, if you’re making cold calls, you are
doing everything wrong. Cold Calling 2.0 means prospecting into cold accounts to generate new business
without using any “cold calls.” I define a cold call as “calling someone who
doesn’t know you and who isn’t expecting your call.” No one enjoys this—
neither the caller nor the person being called, right? Cold Calling 2.0 also means you have processes and a system in place to
generate new pipeline and leads predictably—that is, an organization knows how
“x effort” will lead to “y results”. In fact, it can be the most predictable source of
pipeline at a company, done right—as with companies like Salesforce.com,
WPromote or Responsys. While Cold Calling 2.0 is a system with many steps, there was one original
breakthrough that started the snowball rolling. In early 2003 I was experimenting with regular cold calling, banging the phones,
to see if it worked.",
3256,Predictable Revenue,"Cold calling worked a little bit, and far too slowly: through
cold calling, I found I could generate two highly qualified opportunities per
month. I’m emphasizing high quality because frequently outbound sales teams
pump up their results by throwing over lots of poorly-qualified demos and
appointments to their Account Executives. So when I say “high quality,” I mean
it. Back to March 2003…my goal was to generate at least eight highly qualified
opportunities per month. I was doing two per month through cold calling. OUCH. How was I going to quadruple my results? Breakthrough #1: 
The biggest bottleneck in prospecting into companies that have more than a few
executives isn’t getting to the decision maker/influencer/point person…it’s
finding them in the first place! Oftentimes the ultimate decision maker—such as the CEO or VP Sales in the
case of Salesforce.com, is not the best person for your first conversations.",
3257,Predictable Revenue,"And in
larger companies, there can be so many people with the word “sales” or
“marketing” in their title, it’s impossible from the outside to tell who does what. I learned this through hard work—cold calling, cold emailing, plugging away. I
realized I spent most of my time hunting for the right person—not trying to sell
or qualify them. If I could find the right person, I could usually have a productive business
conversation with them. But it took a LOT of time to find them, especially in
those byzantine Fortune 5000 companies! In Desperation, I Tried An Experiment
I’d always assumed that mass emailing executives wouldn’t work. Don’t I need
to carefully craft each email to them to make it personal? I wrote one email that was a classic cold calling letter: “Do you have these
challenges? X, Y Z…”
I also wrote a totally “short and sweet” different email—in plain text, with no
HTML -- simply asking for a referral to the right person at the company.",
3258,Predictable Revenue,"(I don’t
share the actual email templates in this book for two reasons, which I will share
in the section about email). Here was a lesson learned in the value of a) not assuming anything, and b)
experimenting:
On a Friday afternoon, I sent two mass emails from Salesforce.com:
100 of the “classic sales” emails to Fortune 5000 executives, and
100 of the “short and sweet” emails to the same kind of list. Out of 200 emails I sent, the next morning when I checked email, I had 10
responses sitting in my inbox! Again, these were from C-level and VP-level
executives at large companies—just the people with whom I wanted to talk. Response rate for the “sales-y” email: 0%. Response rate for the “short and sweet” email: 10%! (10 responses out of the
100 short and sweet emails.) And at least five of the emails I received from the
short and sweet campaign were positive, referring me to other people in the
organization as the best person for a conversation about sales force automation.",
3259,Predictable Revenue,"Breakthrough #2: 
Mass emailing C-level Fortune 5000 executives, with specific kinds of emails,
can generate 9%+ response rates. Those high response rates (7-9% or more) from high-level executives have held
true year after year, even with my current clients in 2011, seven years later. A 500% Increase In Results
In the next month, April 2003, I increased my results by 500% and generated 11
highly qualified sales opportunities that continued on in live sales cycles. (And
this increase in opportunities did later lead to an equal increase in revenue.)
The tipping point of the Cold Calling 2.0 process was born: sending mass emails
to high level executives to ask for referrals to the best person in their
organization for a first conversation. The Complexities Of High-Volume And Growth
It’s one thing for a single person to send out emails and generate responses in a
week or a month.",
3260,Predictable Revenue,"It’s another to create a regular stream of opportunities that
come in from that person and a whole team year after year. Your first email campaign is just a first step of a much longer journey. Much of the Cold Calling 2.0 content in this book (and outside of this book)
relates to ensuring your system predictably generates results over years, and with
almost any kind of salesperson or size of team. Terms And Abbreviations
Everyone uses all kinds of different terms in sales. Here are the main terms I use
in this book, and what they mean:
Sales Development Representative (or “SDR”): This is a Cold Calling
2.0 or “outbound” sales rep. Ideally they are specialized, just generating
outbound leads. They neither close deals nor qualify inbound website leads. Outbound Sales Rep: Another term for an “SDR.”
Account Executive (or “AE”): A quotacarrying salesperson, whether they
are an inside sales rep or in the field.",
3261,Predictable Revenue,"Market Response Rep (or “MRR”): An inside salesperson who only
qualifies leads coming in from a website. Sales Force Automation (or “SFA”): Software or internet-based services
that sales teams use to manage all of their contacts and accounts, automate
sales processes, and report on sales results. Customer Relationship Management (or “CRM”): Software-or internet-
based services that typically include Sales Force Automation functions plus
features for marketing and customer service, so that all of the main ways a
company interacts with customers is managed through a single system. Within a company, misunderstanding of terms and roles is a common source of
confusion in executive teams. Ensure your people have a set of terms that are
agreed upon and everybody understands. RIP Cold Calling
Why Aren’t Old Techniques Effective Anymore? Although once in awhile a cold call or classic new business letter might work,
it’s becoming rarer.",
3262,Predictable Revenue,"There are three dynamics in the market that have changed
the nature of prospecting and what works:
1. Buyers are sick of being sold to, and become more resistant every year to
classic sales and marketing methods, such as pushy cold calls or generic
marketing materials. 2. Sales 2.0 technologies, both of CRM systems and Sales 2.0 applications,
make it easier than ever to take the guesswork out of implementing,
executing and auditing the ROI of a prospecting methodology. 3. More accountability on marketing budgets. There is ever-increasing
pressure for lead generation and marketing budgets to show documented
proof of revenue results. Every project is scrutinized: “What’s the ROI? How do you know?” Executives want proof of revenue generated. Have
you ever done a careful measurement of your cold calling programs? Chances are they are much more productive in terms of amount of activity
than revenue. Executives are taking closer looks at these programs, and not
liking what they see.",
3263,Predictable Revenue,"How Is Cold Calling 2.0 Different? I define a cold call is “calling someone who doesn’t know you and who isn’t
expecting your call.”
Cold Calling 2.0 means prospecting into cold accounts without ever making any
cold calls. More importantly though, executed systematically in high-volume, an
inside Sales Development team devoted exclusively to Cold Calling 2.0 can
become the most predictable and sustainable pipeline engine (and thus revenue)
for the company. Three key principles to developing a team successfully include:
1. No cold calling! Prospect into cold accounts with new methods, other than surprising people
on the phone or trying to negotiate around gatekeepers. For example, use
simple emails to generate referrals to the right people, who then expect (and
often welcome) your call. 2. A focus on results, not activities! That means that dials and calls per day,
or even appointments set, are much less interesting or even important.",
3264,Predictable Revenue,"Rather, track metrics such as qualification calls per dayor week, and
qualified opportunities per month. Calls per day and dials are usually only
tracked during training periods, for coaching purposes while reps ramp up
their pipelines. 3. Everything is systematically process-driven! This includes management
practices, hiring, training, and of course, the actual prospecting process. By
emphasizing repeatability and consistency, the pipeline and revenue ramps
generated by a new Sales Development Rep become very predictable, and
the entire team’s results become highly sustainable. You must carve out time to work on these ""important but not urgent"" priorities. As with eating well and staying away from junk food, it takes discipline and
commitment to follow these principles. If you fall into the trap of being ""so busy
you can't get anything done,"" you will have incredible challenges in building a
foundation of success for your future.",
3265,Predictable Revenue,"Salesforce.com’s Cold Calling 2.0 Story
In 2002, Saleforce.com had begun building a field sales organization dedicated
to larger companies. To supplement the inbound leads they received (generated
mostly through word-of-mouth), the field sales force was expected to prospect to
bring in their own large deals. However, little was happening in the way of
prospecting. Salesforce.com realized that in addition to the field people not making many
calls because of their understandable dislike for cold calls, the ones who were
trying to generate their own business were simply ineffective at it. The environment had changed, and the traditional prospecting techniques of the
1990’s weren’t working. Not only were cold calls ineffective, but also targeted
marketing programs offering high value items (such as business books) produced
disappointing results. Making the field salespeople do cold calls means having your highest-cost (per
hour) sales resource perform the lowest-value (per hour) activity.",
3266,Predictable Revenue,"Salesforce.com decided it needed a new approach to create its own controllable,
predictable source of new pipeline. We began the Cold Calling 2.0 project in
early 2003, and spent a year testing and perfecting the methodology and system
to prove its ability to add incremental revenue at a high ROI, before heavily
investing in building a team around it. Why We Refined And Tested The Process For A Year
While it took me four months to generate my first highly successful month of
new opportunities and qualified pipeline, management had two valid concerns to
address before they invested heavily:
Will the pipeline turn into revenue? In other words: Will the deals close? Can
junior salespeople do this too, that is, can it scale? We promoted a junior salesperson to be a second member on my team. I trained
him and he quickly began generating the same results as I had. Also, over the
second half of 2003, a significant amount of pipeline closed.",
3267,Predictable Revenue,"We ended the year
with more than $1,000,000 in new bookings (at least $3,000,000 in lifetime
value), which cost less than $150,000 to generate (about 1.5 fully-loaded
salaries). No wonder that in early 2004 the Salesforce.com management team decided to
grow the Cold Calling 2.0 effort from two people to twelve! A key advantage we had was the Salesforce.com application itself. We would
never have produced the same level of results without using Salesforce.com’s
software. The traditional sales systems (such as ACT, Goldmine, Siebel) would
have held us back as slow, unintuitive and lacking the capabilities we needed
around things like easy sharing of a common database, reporting and
dashboards. They could have worked for a small team of one or two people, but
they wouldn’t have been able to keep up with our team’s growth as we grew to
six, twelve, twenty, etc. Despite some serious obstacles, which are detailed below, results quickly
followed!",
3268,Predictable Revenue,"Serious Cold Calling 2.0 Challenges At Salesforce.com
You might assume that the prospecting was easy ""just because it was
Salesforce.com,"" now a well known brand, and those companies would take our
calls. Nothing could be further from the truth. Although today Salesforce.com is
a globally recognized brand company and the Software-as-aService (SaaS)
licensing model is broadly accepted, back in the early and mid-2000’s, things
were different:
Salesforce.com was unknown and misunderstood in most companies. If someone
had heard of Salesforce.com, they typically thought, “Don’t you offer outsourced
sales teams?”
Salesforce.com was pioneering the concept of Software-as-aService, offering its
products online and on-demand; SaaS had not yet become accepted by
mainstream companies. Furthermore, traditional prospecting techniques just didn’t work. (That's why I
decided to throw out all the books and legacy ideas and start from scratch.",
3269,Predictable Revenue,"Because I had zero sales experience prior to Salesforce.com, I had a fresh
perspective.)
All of these factors stood in our way—but we didn’t give up. The executive team
gave me the time (four months) I needed to keep experimenting until I could
create a process that worked. Are you making excuses (which may sound like extremely logical reasons) for
not finding ways to get around your challenges? Cold Calling 1.0 Vs. Cold Calling 2.0
Here are examples of the different intentions and practices of Cold Calling 1.0
versus Cold Calling 2.0, following many of the trends that have affected all
kinds of selling:
Here are some further thoughts on what has changed:
1. Develop respected experts: The Sales Development role is often treated
within a sales organization as a low-level job. If you treat it that way, you’ll
get low-level results. It’s a challenging and often thankless role. Treat the
team as, and expect them to be, experts. Don’t skimp on training, equipping
or developing them.",
3270,Predictable Revenue,"Set high expectations of their ongoing skills
development. 2. Qualify accounts and contacts before calling: Cold Calling 1.0 involves
calling or emailing into unfiltered industry-based lists of targets. Prospecting into accounts of marginal potential is the most common waste
of time by Sales Development Reps and companies. Spend serious time on
identifying and clarifying your Ideal Customer Profile. Define what
companies are the most similar to your top 5-10% of your customers,
defined as the ones likeliest to purchase for the most revenue, and develop
focused target lists based on these tight criteria. 3. Research rather than sell: When reps do call into cold accounts, rather
than cold calls, make “research calls.” The intention is different, rather than
trying to get the decision maker on the phone, a rep simply learns about the
company and whether there is even a potential fit or not. 4. Blackberry-sized emails: Avoid sending long sales emails that no one
reads.",
3271,Predictable Revenue,"Send emails that are very short (readable on a blackberry) and to the
point. Be honest and to the point—what are you looking for? 5. Go beyond basic SFA: Leverage your sales force automation (“SFA”)
systems in every way possible. For example, you MUST use dashboards. What about applications for de-duplication and data cleansing, contact
acquisition, or tools that tell you when prospects that you are in touch with
visit your website? There is a wealth of options now to enhance every step
of your process — in fact, there are so many options it can be confusing! Don’t let that stop you from constantly testing new applications to see what
works for your company. Could Cold Calling 2.0 Work For My Company? Are people involved in the process of finding new clients? Are your customers worth more than $5,000 to you? (It can work for smaller
amounts, but it will be harder for you to make it profitable). Then this can work for you, whether you’re selling products or services.",
3272,Predictable Revenue,"The results we created aren’t unique to Salesforce.com. For example, Responsys
was the very first company Erythean Martin, my partner at the time, and I
worked with to help implement the system. Within four months they increased the pipeline generated per Sales Development
person by 300% and Cold Calling 2.0 become the top (and most predictable)
source of new pipeline for in the company. The Cold Calling 2.0 process works for consulting and services companies as
well, though it is more challenging. Professional services companies tend to
have developed their business based more on relationships and brand than on
specific benefits. Services companies have to spend extra time honing in on their
Ideal Customer Profiles and their challenges, to make this worthwhile. Of
course, this is necessary for any lead generation project, not just Cold Calling
2.0.",
3273,Predictable Revenue,"Ultimately, if the will and commitment exists in the CEO and executive team to
make it happen, and they can let go of their past cold calling assumptions and
follow this new process, it will work. Why Account Executives Should Not Make Cold Calls
There are three problems with expecting your Account Executives (quota
carrying salespeople) -- whether they are inside or field based -- to be the ones to
do all the work developing new accounts:
They don’t like to do it. They usually aren’t any good at it (or are even terrible at it). It’s a poor use of company resources by using the most expensive sales role
to do lower-value work. Where And When Account Executives Should Prospect 
Here are the rules of thumb about where Account Executives should spend their
precious time prospecting:
A short, targeted “Top 5” or “Top 10” list of strategic accounts to penetrate. Their current customer base. Developing referral or channel partners.",
3274,Predictable Revenue,"The point is to focus your highest value people on the low-volume but high-
value activities (building relationships at key accounts), and specialize other
roles and sales reps to take over low-value yet high-volume activities
(prospecting into untargeted cold accounts). Case Study
Cold Calling 2.0 Example: HyperQuality Triples Results In 90
Days
Note from Aaron: My partner Marylou Tyler was a natural with the Cold Calling
2.0 outbound sales process! Here’s how she helped her first Cold Calling 2.0
client triple their results in 90 days. A Problem Of Inbound Inquiries 
HyperQuality, Inc., a Seattle-based contact center quality assurance solution
provider, has been around for seven years, with customers such as Barclays,
Sirius FM, Carlson Travel, AT&T, Orkin, Vonage, and Travelocity. Customers
subscribe to their service for $100,000 to $1+ million per year, so every high-
quality lead matters, and they used to be hard to generate.",
3275,Predictable Revenue,"Until they met Marylou, HyperQuality got most of their leads from inbound
inquiries from people who emailed, filled out forms on their website, or called
their 800 number. While the flow of inbound inquiries was consistent, thanks
largely to the efforts they made in their search engine optimization (“SEO”) and
pay-per-click (“PPC”) programs, too many of the inquiries were low quality
leads that didn’t fit HyperQuality’s qualification criteria. Some common reasons
included:
Budget: There was no defined budget or the budget was far too small. Authority: The decision maker had no idea that someone lower-level in
their organization was doing research, and had no intention of becoming
involved. Need: The inbound lead didn’t have a recognized problem, they were just
“looking around”. Timing: The inquiry had no timeframe, or the timing was too far in the
future to be serious. Fit:The inquiry needed a service or product that
HyperQuality’s didn’t provide.",
3276,Predictable Revenue,"HyperQuality generated 1-2 inbound leads per month that passed their rigorous
qualification standards. To meet their growth targets, they needed a drastic
increase in pipeline. Also, the quotacarrying Account Executives also qualified
leads coming in from the website, which meant they spend a lot of expensive
time following up on inquiries that went nowhere. Stop Doing More Of What Doesn’t Work
Bob Kelly, Senior Vice President of Sales & Marketing at HyperQuality, knew
he needed a better way to fill the pipeline for his sales team. He brought in
Marylou Tyler to implement the Cold Calling 2.0 outbound sales process. Under Bob’s leadership and commitment to the change, his sales teams
completely embraced this “new” way of prospecting, including:
Creating a new, dedicated outbound sales development role focused 100%
on outbound prospecting. Never making another cold call again, and instead using the Cold Calling
2.0 email process to easily get referrals to decision makers at accounts.",
3277,Predictable Revenue,"The closers focused on their live pipeline, closing deals and only prospected
to a small number of strategic accounts. Companies must make these kinds
of changes in order to create a highly effective outbound sales team. Testing & Refining
Bob and the team met weekly with Marylou to review the progress of the new
initiative. Each week, the first topic discussed on the company-wide sales
agenda was the new outbound sales process, reviewing metrics such as:
Email response rates (usually 7-10%)
What e-mails are companies responding to, and why
Who is responding (title, position of authority)
Number of Scoping Calls completed
Who became a qualified opportunity, and why
Refinements to the Ideal Customer Profile (which was revised many, many
times)
With this consistent focus on making the new process work (and following the
step-by-step process to the letter), the team began to get responses from targeted
accounts in days and a flow of high-level appointments in weeks.",
3278,Predictable Revenue,"The Pipeline Tripled Like “Magic”
Within 90 days, HyperQuality went from generating two leads to eight per
month that fit HyperQuality’s strict criteria…and this was just with parttime
prospecting work by one person. (Aaron note: once ramped up, a single full-time
outbound rep can generate 10-20 excellent leads per month.)
The process and Marylou’s help was called “magic” by the sales team! Just like Salesforce.com and HyperQuality, companies that implement the Cold
Calling 2.0 process can turn pipeline generation off-and-on like a faucet, binserty
changing the number of dedicated outbound prospectors on the team and how
much outreach they do, and create an ability to penetrate new industries or
geographic markets at will (the process also works in Asia and Europe). 3
Executing Cold Calling 2.0
OK, so how do you do it? This isn’t a true step-by-step manual (which would go
beyond the scope of this book), but it will give you enough direction to get going
on your own.",
3279,Predictable Revenue,"Getting Started With Cold Calling 2.0
The following sections contain a lot of specific details and steps on how you can
get started on your own with this process. Much more detailed how-to’s and
training videos can be obtained through our products and coaching. To begin implementing the Cold Calling 2.0 system, you should have:
At least one person 100% dedicated to prospecting (or you intend to have
this person). Yes, you can start parttime, but it will be hard to get significant
results until you have someone totally committed to it. You have some kind of sales system that lets your sales team share and
manage their sales contacts and accounts. Salesforce.com is still the best
system (in my humble though admittedly biased opinion) but what's more
important is that you have something beyond spreadsheets, whiteboards and
email. Your prospects use email. You have a proven product or service that has generated revenue.",
3280,Predictable Revenue,"The “lifetime value of a customer” is more than $10,000 (the more the
better). The process will definitely work if your lifetime value is lower
(especially if you’re a singleowner business doing this for yourself), but it
becomes more challenging to make it profitable through hired salespeople. Experiment To Make It Work For You
Every business is different, and things work differently for each salesperson. The
idea here is to give you a set of tools, with some guidance, that you can
experiment with and customize to make work for your own special situation. Remember: Treat these tools with an attitude of experimentation. Play with
them. Find out what works best for you. The Most Important First Step
If you want to take an important step towards turning your sales organization
into a sales machine, start by letting your Account Executives (the sales reps
closing business) focus on what they do best: work active sales cycles and close.",
3281,Predictable Revenue,"Let a different role, Sales Development Reps, focus on generating new qualified
opportunities for your Account Executives. As a first step, dedicate a role (whether you begin with one person or a whole
team) to ONLY doing outbound prospecting activities. Break it off from inbound
lead qualification and from closing. This is so important that I mention it several times in this book: Specialize,
Specialize, Specialize! Implement a Sales Development function to prospect for new clients to ensure a
predictable, sustainable supply of qualified leads for the field and/ or telesales
teams, and a Market Response function to qualify the leads that come into your
website, through the telephone or other “inbound” channels. 1. Sales Development Reps prospect into cold or inactive companies who
aren’t engaging with you already, to source new, incremental sales
opportunities and pass them to quotacarrying salespeople.",
3282,Predictable Revenue,"In the past this team would have been making cold calls, though today there are
much more effective ways to prospect. Organize Sales Development Reps by
territories that match the field and telesales reps, because it’s vital for them to
build relationships with their sales teammates. One Sales Development Rep typically can support a maximum of 2-5
quotacarrying Account Executives. If you sell very large deals, it’s possible you
could have even a 1-to-1 ratio or 2-to-1 Sales Development Reps per Account
Executive and still be VERY profitable. By the way, while adding a dedicated Sales Development function can vastly
improve your outbound prospecting results, we’re not saying your quotacarrying
salespeople should not do any new business generation — far from it! However, Account Executive closers shouldn’t spend their time making cold
calls.",
3283,Predictable Revenue,"They should focus on higher-potential sources of business: a small list of
targeted accounts at which they can build relationships, current clients, or their
own past dead opportunities. 2. Market Response Reps qualify incoming leads that reach the company
through the website or phone (usually driven either by internet search,
word-of-mouth or marketing programs), and route qualified opportunities
to the appropriate quotacarrying salesperson. A rule of thumb is that for every 400 leads per month that require human
attention, a company needs one Market Response Representative. By removing unqualified opportunities out of the pipeline early in the sales
cycle, Market Response determines which accounts will be followed up by the
sales force and thereby paves the way for increased close rates by the field and
telesales, who spend their time only on pre-qualified opportunities.",
3284,Predictable Revenue,"Why Sales Development and Market Response Should Be
Separated
In companies where incoming lead volume justifies having a dedicated market
response function, separate the Market Response from Sales Development to
make both teams more focused and productive. The roles are very different (inbound reps receive leads to work to qualify, while
outbound reps initiate calls and emails), and it’s very challenging for a rep to
switch between the two mindsets throughout the day. The Market Response Reps become experts at efficiently qualifying inbound and
marketing-generated leads, and the Sales Development team only prospects for
incremental business at accounts that need to be pursued, where there is no
active or pre-existing interest.",
3285,Predictable Revenue,"How We Learned This The Hard Way At Salesforce.com
Salesforce.com learned this the hard way in 2004, when we changed from
having separate Sales Development teams doing inbound and outbound roles, to
having the same team handle both inbound and outbound responsibilities. Within a week, productivity had dropped by 30%. Within three weeks, it was
clear that the productivity drop was caused by the mixing of the responsibilities
and was not going to improve with time. Salesforce.com quickly changed the
structure back to separate teams doing Sales Development and Market Response
functions, and productivity rose back to prior levels. It was this kind of specialization that was important to helping achieve massive
breakthroughs in results. Through 2008, the Cold Calling 2.0 team at
Salesforce.com (the“EnterpriseBusiness RepresentativeTeam”)had sourced about
$100 million in recurring annual revenue for Salesforce.com.",
3286,Predictable Revenue,"Year after year,
return on investment on each person in the role was about 3000%. Choosing A Sales Force Automation System

never heard of Salesforce.com! Having worked at Salesforce.com for four years, and done consulting with
dozens of companies since then, I’ve talked with customers of every kind of
system you can imagine. While it is far from perfect, Salesforce.com is still (as of 2011) the best sales
force automation system out there. There are good reasons why more than a
MILLION people use it, and why they do more than $1 BILLION in revenue per
year. My sales team could never have produced the results and level of productivity
without Salesforce.com, which enabled us to do more and produce higher quality
work. Having said that, whichever system you choose and use, the most important
thing is that you use it.",
3287,Predictable Revenue,"If you’re having problems benefiting from it, remember a
system is just a tool — it’s more likely that the problems are coming from the
users, not the tool itself. And CEOs, remember: people follow your example. The more you live in your
system, the more your people will use it. The Source Of Predictability: Cold Calling 2.0 Funnel
Here is the source your PREDICTABLE REVENUE comes from: predictable
lead generation. For companies selling high-value products or services, the most predictable
source of leads (whether or not it’s the largest source) can be outbound sales
prospecting. Here is a sample funnel that breaks out the prospecting stages:
As you can see, if you experiment with your process, people and activities to
find how to generate a predictable flow of new qualified opportunities, and have
a consistent sales closing rate, you can begin to generate highly predictable
revenue and proactive growth.",
3288,Predictable Revenue,"Revenue Predictability = The Funnel + Average Deal Size + Time 
In addition to these activities and results funnel, you also have to know how long
things take in order to have more predictability. Time: Ramping New Reps
Measure and pay attention to the reality (rather than your unrealistic
expectations) of how long your reps take to ramp up their results. This amount of time can and will vary widely from company to company,
depending on your lead flow, the people you hire, how well you train them, and
whether they’re picking up an established territory or starting a brand new one. My advice: Put new reps through some kind of training program that has them
working in other parts of your company first, talking to customers, before they
go on active sale duty. This will make them much more effective salespeople and
actually ramp them faster. Slow down to speed up! Time: Prospecting and Sales Cycle Lengths
How long does it take for a prospector to generate a qualified opportunity?",
3289,Predictable Revenue,"How
long does it take for those opportunities to close? Are small ones faster than
large ones? What are some imperfect but useful rules of thumb for you? Prospecting cycle length: Measure the time between a) when the prospect first
responds to a campaign to b) when a quality opportunity is created or qualified
(this means the quotacarrying Account Executive has re-qualified and accepted
the opportunity that the prospector passed over). Incidentally, my rule of thumb is that it takes 2-4 weeks, on average, to qualify a
new opportunity from an initial response. Sales cycle length: I like to measure the time from a) when the opportunity was
created or qualified to b) when it closed. If you have trouble measuring this, just sit down with your reps and have a 15
minute conversation to talk about the last 10 deals that closed, to get a rough
ballpark of the length. Example:
To use realistic numbers, let’s assume:
A new prospector takes two months to ramp to full quota.",
3290,Predictable Revenue,"Each rep produces 10 new, qualified opportunities per month. Deal size is $100,000
In this case, after two months an outbound rep will be producing $1 million in
new qualified pipeline per month. Now, if:
Sales win rates are 20%, and
Sales cycles average six months... ...then each new prospecting rep (working with their quotacarrying Account
Executives) will be adding an incremental $200,000 in new revenue each month,
with the flow really beginning about eight months after the outbound rep was
hired (or six months after they reached full production). Does eight months seem like a long time in our world of quick-fixes? What if
you had started this team or this process eight months ago, wouldn’t you love
having that revenue right now? Once you get this machine rolling, like a flywheel, this predictable source of
new leads will keep producing revenue.",
3291,Predictable Revenue,"How Cold Calling 2.0 Works, The Process
Here is an overview of the Cold Calling 2.0 process, for a Sales Development
Rep that is doing it full-time and passing opportunities to a quotacarrying
salesperson. If you are a sales rep who can only prospect parttime, adjust the goals
accordingly (send half of the volume of outbound emails, for example), and
obviously the last step (“pass the baton”) won’t apply to you. Step 1. Get Clear On Your Ideal Customer Profile 
The simple most important thing you can do to make this program effective is to
spend time getting clear on who your ideal customers are — both the kinds of
accounts and the types of contacts in them. This is where most companies fall short from the start, by targeting the wrong
prospects, at the wrong levels, going after too many kinds of companies, or not
speaking in‘their language’. Step 2. Build Your List 
How can you build a database of the above kinds of prospects? Do you already
have a list in-house? Can you buy one?",
3292,Predictable Revenue,"Or do you need to build one from
scratch…? Most companies approach and sell too low. Do you have decision-makers (or
their bosses) as well as lower level people? How targeted is your list? Is it
cluttered with non-relevant companies or people? Resist any temptation to throw in lists of random prospects just because you
have them—there is an opportunity cost to marketing to poor-fit prospects. Responses from people who don’t fit your customer criteria will just end up
wasting your time and cluttering your database. Step 3. Run Outbound Email Campaigns 
Don't make this mistake: companies are too dependent on cold calls. Phone skills
are critical, but use calls as the second step in prospecting. Begin with email, and
then use phone to follow up to people who respond. Simple email templates can
get you an 8-12%-plus response rate even from high-level prospects. Send outbound mass emails or mass voicemails to prospects that fit your Ideal
Customer Profile.",
3293,Predictable Revenue,"These emails should look as if they are a single email that
came from a salesperson. They should be text-based, not fancy HTML (though
you can use HTML templates that look like text). Rather than sending hundreds of mass emails at a time in big bursts, the idea
here is to send a regular, smaller number (50-100) of emails per salesperson each
day, a few days a week, as a rolling campaign. The main goal of this stage is to
generate just 5-10 new responses per day. Reps can’t handle more responses than
that per day without dropping balls. Step 4. Sell The Dream 
Do this: Work your responses and referrals to make contact with the right
executives, and then “Sell The Dream.” by helping them paint a vision of what
kinds of solutions will solve their problems. Then connect your solution to their
key business issue(s) and dream. Don't treat your front-line sales reps as appointment-setting machines... setting
up all kinds of meetings to which prospects don't show up.",
3294,Predictable Revenue,"Do you have
outbound reps that are only trained to push product, read from scripts or push
demos? Or can they create a vision with a prospect and start building trust,
credibility and rapport? Step 5. Pass The Baton (With Dedicated Sales Development Reps) 
If all your prospecting is done by your quotacarrying sales reps, you are making
a fatal mistake. If you are committed to the results you want, you must have a
team of reps dedicated to outbound prospecting, who generate new qualified
opportunities to pass to closers to run with. There is a science to doing this,
including transferring over the relationship, in ways that generate consistent and
quality results. It is vital that you have a simple and clear process to pass new leads smoothly
from your dedicated prospectors to your quotacarrying Account Executives. Don’t let anyone drop the baton! First, I’ll share a sample Cold Calling 2.0 Prospecting Funnel, and then in the
following sections I'll go into each step in more detail.",
3295,Predictable Revenue,"Step 1: Get Clear On Your Ideal Customer Profile
What is the most important exercise you MUST do to get better results from
marketing and sales? Answer: Get clear on your Ideal Customer Profile,
including how to describe them, and what their core challenges are. You’ll need
to revise it many times before you feel “clear”—this is not a one-time exercise. The Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) helps us maximize sales and marketing
productivity by:
Finding great prospects more easily through smart targeting;
and,
Disqualifying poor prospects more quickly. (Both of which lead us to faster sales cycles and higher win rates.)
This is a collection of sample Ideal Customer Profile criteria purely for
illustrative purposes, with both positive and red flags. You will need to rewrite
all of them from scratch, including adding or subtracting different types of
criteria. The ICP should, ideally, fit on a single page.",
3296,Predictable Revenue,"Design it this way to keep it simple: when we hire a new employee, how can you
educate them as quickly as possible about what kinds of companies they should
be striving to work with, or avoid? Smart Targeting
You don’t need this many criteria as are listed below, even 3-5 key ones will help
you. In fact, fewer, better criteria will make it easier to benefit from this
exercise…. Red Flags And Deal Breakers 
What signals or signs can you look for, as early in the sales process as possible,
to warn you (and the client) that working together is a waste of time? Here are
some examples of red flags:
They just installed a _______ kind of system. They already have an agency/service provider in place, or a full-time in-
house person dedicated to ___. They churn-and-burn the consultants or agencies they hire to do
_____________. Know-it-alls / “We know what we’re doing.”
Geography. Their monthly budget for ________ is only ________. These industries never seem to work: _____, _____, _____.",
3297,Predictable Revenue,"This area of work is totally new to them, and they don’t understand it yet. (That is, you would have to do a lot of education of the client before they
would even understand the value of your service.)
Ideal Contacts 
You should also apply this exercise to the kinds of buyers and influencers you
work with, who buy from you. “Our ideal contact is a VP Sales who is new to their role (less than 90 days in),
who is looking to make things happen. They are process-oriented, report to the
CEO or division president, and love data and reports. Their challenges include
not being able to give accurate reports to their CEO because of problems with
their sales system or the data in it…”
Their Core Challenges 
As a final exercise in getting clear on your ideal customer profile, what are the
core challenges of the company and of the individuals involved in the buying
process? You can learn these easily, just by asking!",
3298,Predictable Revenue,"Whether by phone or by an online
survey like SurveyMonkey, ask prospects and clients questions such as:
What are your greatest challenges? What keeps you up at night? What are your main frustrations? What are you afraid of? What’s most important to you? What do you spend money on? What do you really, really, REALLY want? Refresh Regularly 
Finally, you can have more than one kind of ""ideal customer"" and you also might
have ""ideal partners."" Limit yourself to 1-5 types of profiles. If you think you
need more than that, your marketing strategy needs focusing. Step 2: Building Your List Of Targets
There are books and online resources about how to build marketing lists; that
topic is beyond the scope of this book. This section will, however, point you in
the right direction if you’re unsure where to begin. Different sources of leads and contacts are appropriate for different businesses. Targeting Fortune 5000? Try out OneSource. Targeting small business?",
3299,Predictable Revenue,"Avoid
OneSource and go for InfoUSA (as one example). Jigsaw (now owned by
Salesforce.com) is perhaps the best general-purpose source of contacts with
email addresses. For individual sales reps or marketing directors selling to businesses larger than
a couple hundred employees, we recommend using the popular services, most of
which also integrate into Salesforce.com and perhaps other sales applications:
Jigsaw (now owned by Salesforce.com)

DataSalad (which is unique in that it has databases of companies that use
certain applications, as I describe in the next section). ZoomInfo vs. Jigsaw 
At the time of this printing, my partner Marylou Tyler, the CEO of
PredictableRevenue.com, had just completed a preliminary test of the quality of
data between Jigsaw and ZoomInfo. In short, she was surprisingly impressed that ZoomInfo had much higher quality
of data, with 1) a much lower bounce rate and 2) higher response rate from
prospects.",

Brian Carroll has a nice post here to help you think about building lists:
http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/2007/03/would_you_buy_t.html
DataSalad: Fresh B2B Marketing Data
When running the Salesforce.com lead generation team, I wish I would have had
lists of the customers of competitors such as Oracle, Siebel and NetSuite.",
3301,Predictable Revenue,"In 2008 I founded DataSalad with Brian Mackley (CEO, DeepWWW), because
he had a technology that could produce those kinds of lists, and we were both
tired of all the junky lists and data sources being hocked and resold. Another ex-
Salesforce.com colleague, John Bogard, joined us as a partner in 2010. DataSalad has lists of companies that are clients of and use specific applications
—such as a list of customers of Salesforce.com, a list of Webex customers, and
much more. Where The Lists And Data Come From
People and companies leave all kinds of “digital fingerprints” on the Web. DataSalad generates the list of application-specific customers by crawling
dozens of different sources of online information and databases, such as job
boards and discussion groups. Then the technology interprets these fingerprints and fragments to reassemble
the data together into full records. The data is verified and crosschecked prior to
being added to our database.",
3302,Predictable Revenue,"DataSalad maintains lists of application-specific customers of companies like
Salesforce.com, NetSuite, Webex, Oracle, SAP, GreatPlains and more. Just as with the other sources, you have to try some lists, A/B split-test and
measure results to determine what works best for your company. Step 3: Run Outbound Email Campaigns
The primary tool used by your outbound prospectors to get in front of new
prospects is mass emailing. First, use email to generate internal referrals to the
right person(s) at the target company. Then follow up on the responses and
referrals with phone calls. Ideally the reps are sending these mass emails through either your Sales Force
Automation system (like Salesforce.com), or through a marketing automation
system that integrates to your Sales Force Automation System. On any given
day, the rep should send 50-100 targeted mass emails with a goal of having 5-10
responses per day (assuming about a 10% response rate). “Targeted” mass emails sounds like an oxymoron.",
3303,Predictable Revenue,"Here’s how they’re targeted:
filter your list carefully according to the specific kind of account or contact you
want to touch. Examples of filters include:
1. Vertical (retail, finance, high tech, etc)
2. Revenue
3. Geography / Territory
4. Employee count
5. Business model (B2B, B2C, agency)
6. Last Contact Activity Date
7. Last Account Activity Date
8. Contact Title (CEO, Director of Marketing, etc.)
9. Virtually anything else you are tracking
So even if you have a database of thousands of names, an SDR can segment
down their total prospect pool into small groups that can be messaged with
highly relevant information. Writing Your Emails
Although I share my email templates with clients, I don’t share email templates
here for two reasons:
1. When you copy someone else’s template, you lose your company’s
authentic voice. 2. If everyone uses the same email templates, the templates will likely lose
their effectiveness. Below are some guidelines for writing your own templates.",
3304,Predictable Revenue,"If you don’t want to
reinvent the wheel, or are struggling to get your response rates up, we have
products with templates you can purchase. Guidelines For Writing Your Own Emails
These are guidelines for writing emails to cold prospects to start a conversation. Once you begin communicating, you can shift towards longer emails with more
content, but in the beginning:
These emails should look as if they are a single email that came from a
salesperson. They should be text-based, not fancy HTML. State simply and clearly why you are reaching out. Make the email easy to read and respond to on a blackberry or smartphone. Offer credibility (e.g., examples of customers). Ask just one simple-to-answer question (such as for a referral). And BE HONEST in all your communications, whether by phone or email. One trick that I’ve seen reps use is to send an email to a new contact with a
subject starting with “Re:” to make it look like they are responding to the
prospect.",
3305,Predictable Revenue,"Do you really want to start the relationship off with a lie? If you’re a
CEO or sales manager, don’t allow or encourage anything that erodes integrity. An Example Of What NOT To Write
Subject: Improve sales effectiveness in Q2? Chuck,
Are you continually challenged to project accurate revenue? Do you know who your best reps are and what makes them successful? Do you know which marketing activities your company engages in are
generating closed deals? You know there are some big deals in the pipeline, but can you easily
generate a real-time report detailing their status? Does this sound familiar? You face the same challenges as many other
companies. Salesforce.com has proven to be successful at leading global
companies such as Adobe Systems, AOL Time Warner Communications,
Putnam Lovell, Dow Jones Newswires, Berlitz Global Net, Siemens,
Microstrategy and Autodesk, to name a few. Salesforce.com is a web-based CRM service that can be rapidly rolled out
and is easy to use.",
3306,Predictable Revenue,"Sales organizations use it to centralize and report on
contacts, accounts, and historical activities and to track sales performance. Marketing can easily measure the ROI of individual projects. Salesforce.com makes it very easy to customize reports and gain visibility
into your sales organization and individuals' performance to get a better
handle on your business. Could we schedule 20 minutes of time to discuss this? Or would someone
else in your organization be a more appropriate contact? Warm regards, Aaron Ross
The above email is too long, impersonal, hard to read on a blackberry, sales-y
and just uninteresting. Response rate: ZERO. Sending Your Campaigns
Start by sending 150-250 outbound emails per week, over the course of 3-4 days. Again, your goal is to receive an average of 5-10 responses per day, because if
you get more than that, they will start dropping through the cracks. One of the
biggest mistakes our clients make is sending too many emails per day.",
3307,Predictable Revenue,"Send the messages either before 9am or after 5pm, and avoid Mondays and
Fridays. (Sundays are okay.)
If you are using emails, expect a 7-9%+ response rate (excluding bounces). This
rate includes all responses: positive, negative and neutral. For most newly built or purchased lists, you will get a 20-30% bounce rate,
exclude those emails from your response rate calculation. So if you send 150
emails and receive 10 responses and 50 bounces, your response rate is 10% (10
responses / 100 valid emails). Be methodical in how you handle responses! Response handling is critical to
make sure no responses fall through the cracks. Log them and keep them
organized. I suggest you create some standard email templates you can use for
your most common responses. Don’t ignore bounces—clean bad emails out of your database as they come in. Over time they’ll just clutter and fog up everything you do.",
3308,Predictable Revenue,"Learn to love “out of office” replies—those emails have the names and contact
information for more people to target, such as executive assistants who job it is
to help route you to the right person in the company! Mass Email—So You Got A Response
First of all LOG EVERY RESPONSE into Salesforce.com (or your Sales Force
Automation System), and update the contact as necessary. Once you begin doing
high-volume prospecting, sending hundreds of emails per month, it’s very easy
to let great responses fall through the cracks. The goal of every mass email should be to establish and close a prospect on a
next step. That next step should be either one of two things—but NOT both:
Who is the best point of contact for …?” (to get a referral);
Or,
When is the best day/time for a quick discussion around…?” (to set up a
conversation with the prospect). For goal #1, getting a referral, the objective is to confirm the best point of
contact for a first conversation and get referred to them.",
3309,Predictable Revenue,"Then, you can email the
new contact (to whom you are referred) directly while mentioning (or Cc’ing)
the individual who referred you. This shows the new contact that you aren’t
making a cold call and you’ve already been engaged with someone from his or
her team. Internal referrals create the highest likelihood of getting a response. For goal #2, setting up a call, the objective is to set up a quick time to see if
there’s a high level fit between your company and the prospect’s company. This
call should be focused entirely on their business—not your business. You should
lead the conversation and ask open questions that encourage them to talk about
their business—not your business. If you’re talking more than 30% of the time on prospecting or scoping calls, you
need to ask more questions or just keep your mouth shut more. If someone
responds with a negative, “Not interested”, find out why. Remember, “No”
doesn’t matter until you hear it from the CEO or your ideal decision maker.",
3310,Predictable Revenue,"And
even then when you get a No, you should find out why to determine if it’s
coming from an objection you can handle. Oftentimes prospects misunderstand
what you do or what value you offer, and will say “no” out of confusion. Contacts Who Didn’t Respond
If somebody doesn’t respond to your email, that doesn’t mean there isn’t
legitimate potential in the account. By sending mass emails from Salesforce.com
or another system that tracks “email opens,” you can track which prospects
opened your emails and how often they did it (or how many people they’ve
passed your email to). Here’s an example:
Now, rather than having to randomly call prospects, you have a prioritized list of
people to follow up with. Review these reports every few hours. If someone’s opened your email more
than once, call them. If open rates are high, they might have forwarded the email
to a few people.",
3311,Predictable Revenue,"Example “Old Opportunities” Campaign
A great place both to train new salespeople and generate opportunities is to reach
back into old opportunities that have died, and have had no activity for at least
six months. Once a Sales Development Rep is trained and comfortable working with past
leads, it will be easier for them to tackle totally cold accounts. Train them before
you have them call on cold executives! Sending Unsolicited Emails and CAN-SPAM Compliance
As a business, you can send unsolicited email messages to a newly acquired
marketing list. If you use any kind of sales or marketing campaign with emails
that are not “opt-in,” such as purchased from a data service like Jigsaw or list
broker, there are some rules you must follow to stay in compliance with CAN-
SPAM, the anti-spam act. You are allowed to send “unsolicited” emails to businesses. Here are the three
core guidelines:
The subject and header must not be misleading. You must have a valid physical address in your email.",
3312,Predictable Revenue,"You must include a way to opt-out from future communications. For more information, this page at the FTC has further guidance here:
http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/business/ecommerce/bus61.shtm
Step 4: Sell The Dream
So one of your prospectors sets up time to have a full, first conversation with a
prospect. Assuming you are talking with a prospect who is a good fit for your
service, the goal of “Selling The Dream” is NOT to “sell.” It is, rather 1) to help
the prospect create a vision of a dream solution that will solve their problems;
and then 2) to connect your product to their key business issue(s) and dream
solution. In any conversation with a prospect, don’t get eager until you actually see that
they could be a fit. Challenge them as well. How serious are they about solving
their challenges?:
There’s interest, but are they ready to take action? Are you connected with the people with power or influence? Is there real interest in a next step?",
3313,Predictable Revenue,"Outbound prospectors shouldn’t just throw over lots of crummy opportunities
that go nowhere—it is better for them to pass fewer, better opportunities to your
Account Executives. Track everything in your sales force automation system. Once a prospector connects by phone with a prospect for a call to find out if
there is a mutual fit, the biggest challenge is staying focused on the prospect’s
business and not selling yours. Ask open-ended questions about their business first—how it’s organized, for
example—before moving on to ask about challenges. Here are a series of sample questions you can customize and use in a Discovery
Call. Realistically, in a first conversation a prospector might just ask 3-4 of these
questions. They are roughly in order, starting with more general business
questions and leading to more specific qualification questions:
How are your ___ teams/functions organized? How does your ___ process work today?",
3314,Predictable Revenue,"What system(s) do these teams use for sales and lead management? How long has the system been in place? What are your challenges now? (After each answer, keep asking, “What
else?”)
Have you been looking at alternatives yet? Have you tried and failed with other solutions? Why? Where does _____ fall on your priority list? What is higher? What would an ideal solution look like to you? How will your decision-making process work? Why did you buy the old system? Who made the decision to purchase it? What is the probability a project will occur this year [in the next six
months]? Why do it now? (Or why wait until later?)
More Tips For A First Call
Main objective: get them talking about their business and then listen!! Call low before a C-level conversation: Find out how their business works
and current challenges by calling a relevant employee at the company (at
Salesforce.com, we’d call individual sales reps to get the inside scoop).",
3315,Predictable Revenue,"Try being (respectfully) blunt: After you’ve talked, and if their pain isn’t
obvious, ask straight out if there is any pain: “Where do you have pain
today? What’s not working as well is it should?”
Keep asking questions until you’ve exhausted the hunt for pain—their
challenges. Keep digging until there’s nothing left to uncover. Ask for referrals: Who else should you talk to at other divisions / teams? Scheduling via email is a huge time waster. Always work to schedule your
next step while you’re on the phone. Remember, experiment and test these questions and practices to see what works
for your people and business. You will have to customize, tweak and test to get
great results that are repeatable. Building Champions
If the prospect is interested but isn’t ready, or they need to convince more people
on the team, then turn your focus to developing your contact into a Champion,
who can do the selling for you at the account.",
3316,Predictable Revenue,"It’s simpler than you think: focus on what will make that person successful (not
what will make you successful), and ask them how you can support them. Give
them what they need—including time. Check in with them, but don’t bug them. Build trust, be respectful, and be persistent. You’re planting seeds here, and it can take time for the seed to sprout and bloom. Keep “adding water” (giving them love and attention) and practicing patience
with them! Step 5: Pass The Baton (When Is An Opportunity Qualified?)
A question I get from every client is, “How do you define a qualified
opportunity?”, that is, one which the inside Sales Development Rep (SDR)
should pass to an Account Executive (AE), and that the SDR can be
compensated on. In this section, I’m going to be using the terms “Sales Development Rep” and
“Account Executive” a lot, so while I’m not a fan of acronyms, I sometimes will
use “SDR” and “AE” for brevity. This process below was just for the outbound sales process. Salesforce.",
3317,Predictable Revenue,"com had
different qualification criteria for leads coming in through the website (“inbound
leads”), which were routed to a totally different Market Response Reps team. After lots of experimentation, these simple guidelines worked the best for our
outbound generated opportunities…. The Basics
Apart from the qualification criteria, in order to be compensated for a new
opportunity, the Sales Development Rep must find opportunities which:
Have at least a potential of 20+ users (to ensure the sales reps were looking
for large enough opportunities);
Have no fundamental “red flags” or deal-breakers;
The Sales Development Rep clearly generated (no poaching from
“inbound” leads or other SDRs). You must have clear guidelines and rules for reps to follow to help them ensure
they are generating quality leads that are worth the company’s time. An all too common mistake is letting the pressure of “Just get leads in!” stop
reps from disqualifying small deals that are not profitable enough.",
3318,Predictable Revenue,"There is an
opportunity cost to small deals—they waste time and resources that could be
spent looking for or working on larger ones. When An SDR Should Pass An Opportunity To An AE
Fundamentally, when the Sales Development Rep feels it is worth the Account
Executive’s time, that the Account Executive would want to engage this deal,
they pass the opportunity over. There were three guidelines for this:
1. Does the company fit our ideal client profile? 2. Are we speaking with someone with influence or power? 3. Is there a clear interest in a next step, usually in the form of a scoping or
discovery call with an Account Executive? The opportunity is created and passed to the Account Executive still as a “Stage
1: New Prospect” opportunity. Even when passed to the Account Executive, it is
not upgraded yet, and the Sales Development Rep is not compensated for it yet
—not until it is re-qualified by the Account Executive.",
3319,Predictable Revenue,"How To Pass An Opportunity Smoothly 
Best: Hot-transfer the lead to the salesperson. Okay: Schedule a time on the calendars of your sales rep and the new lead
for a discovery call. Last option: Make an email introduction, Cc’ing both the sales rep and the
new lead, with each other's contact information in the email. And of course, the Sales Development Rep needs to log the email/pass in their
sales force automation system, like Salesforce.com, and set up a new task or
calendar item for their Account Executive. The SDR Gets Credit After The Account Executive Re-qualifies 
New opportunities are not upgraded to “qualified” until after the Account
Executive speaks with and re-qualifies them in their own phone call. Do not let
the Sales Development Rep get credit until this happens, it is so critical to
quality control! After the Account Executive speaks to the prospect on the phone and feels good
about the same basic outbound qualification criteria (Can we solve their
problem?",
3320,Predictable Revenue,"Are we in touch with the decision makers? Do they want a next
step?…), the Account Executive can upgrade the opportunity to “Stage 2:
Qualified”. Now the Sales Development Rep can get credit and compensated for it. Use An Audit Process
It requires some extra time, but it is totally worth having a manager or the
company owner review every single outbound opportunity to ensure high quality
and integrity of the results. As soon as an opportunity is upgraded, check it to ensure all of the following:
Was this truly an incremental outbound opportunity? Not an inbound lead
from your website? Was it re-qualified by the Account Executive by phone? (Sometimes an
Account Executive would “do a favor” for their Sales Development Rep
and upgrade opportunities before they re-qualified—a big no-no). Did the Sales Development Rep and Account Executive enter notes into
your sales automation system appropriately?",
3321,Predictable Revenue,"If it doesn’t exist in your
systems, it doesn’t exist, and reps can’t be compensated for it. Back at Salesforce.com, the benefits of this strict auditing process, even though
it took a little extra time and energy, were clear and solid:
When I reported my results up the chain, including to Marc Benioff, I had
total trust in the integrity of the data. I had rock-solid ROI proof of the
team. The auditing forced the Sales Development Reps to step up the quality of
their work, and reduced the temptation to push boundaries, such as
poaching a lead from the inbound team. It created trust within the team that everyone’s results were fair and that no one
was cheating. Improve Call Effectiveness Without Scripts
Call scripts have been a classic tool in telemarketing and sales, but executives
and business people have become much more tuned to canned questions. We use
two simple but much more effective tools to plan and execute calls: AAA Call
Planning and Call Flows.",
3322,Predictable Revenue,"AAA Call Planning 
Even if a salesperson takes just five minutes, they can quickly generate a list of
objectives for their call:
What Answers do you want to learn in the call? What Attitudes do you wish the prospect to feel? What Actions should occur after the call? Call Flows
The order of questions (how the conversation flows) makes a dramatic difference
in the ease and productivity of calls. First, we reverse the classic cold call
method that teaches salespeople to use the first 30 seconds to bark out an
elevator pitch to spark a prospect's interest… because remember, we have
already conversed via email or have a referral before we call. So while the salesperson does want to begin with explaining why they are
calling, and who they and their company are, it’s not a cheesy “cold call pitch.”
Salespeople should use a nonthreatening, research-oriented approach that uses
the first half of the call to learn about the prospect's business and needs.",
3323,Predictable Revenue,"The
salesperson positions their service and value at the end of the call, after they've
uncovered what the prospect actually wants. This means they position the
solution to the specific needs of the prospect without lots of distracting,
irrelevant information and features the prospect doesn’t care about. Below is a typical ""flow"" for a qualification call:
1. Opening (“Did I catch you at a bad time?”) and Introduction
2. Discuss prospect's current business situation (authentic curiosity)
3. Probe for prospect's needs (and confirm understanding of the needs)
4. Position solution to meet those specific needs
5. Handle objections
6. Next steps
You don’t need fancy scripts to help salespeople make effective calls. They can
be useful during training, but don’t let people get dependent on them and lose
their own authentic voice. Use more role-playing training and fewer scripts to teach them how to think on
their feet and have more natural conversations.",
3324,Predictable Revenue,"Leaving Voicemails
Since email is the primary way people communicate today, use voicemail as a
tool to increase response rates from emails rather than to attempt to get people to
call you back (especially when targeting large companies; i.e., small business
people are more likely to return voicemails). Leave voicemails with the same demeanor you would use with a friend or family
member. You want to be disarming and warm, not sales-y, sounding like a
jackass or “corporate” (no personality). You should:
State your name AND number at the beginning and end of the voicemail. This way, if they repeat the voicemail to get your phone number to call you
back, they don’t have to listen to it the whole way through to get to your
number. Speak slowly and clearly. S-p-e-a-k s-l-o-w-l-y a-n-d c-l-e-a-r-l-y. Remember it can be hard to understand phone messages, especially if
someone is calling into their messages through their cell phone.",
3325,Predictable Revenue,"Explain in one or two sentences why you’re calling them and at a
minimum, imply a reason for why they should respond and how:
“Responding to your email,” “Saw you visited our website,” “Wanted to ask
for the courtesy of a response to the email I sent you”…. Say their name at least twice, as people love hearing their own name, and
it’s rapport-building. If you haven’t sent them an email yet, send an email as soon as you leave them
the voicemail—give them more than one way to get back to you. Example 1: “Hi John, this is Aaron Ross from Salesforce.com. My number
is 555-555-5555. John, I sent you an email a couple of days ago and hadn’t
heard back, and I was hoping you could give me a quick courtesy response. I’ll resend it here in a minute. Again, Aaron Ross, 555-555-5555. Thank you
and have a great day.”
Example 2: “Hi John, this is Aaron Ross from Salesforce.com. My number
is 555-555-5555.",
3326,Predictable Revenue,"John, I’m calling to follow up on the email I sent you, I’d
love to hear either way if you can please help me out or not. Again, Aaron
Ross, 555-555-5555. Thank you and have a great day.”
Example 3: (the mysterious version): “Hi John, this is Aaron Ross
following up. My number is 555-555-5555. I’m free after 3pm today. Again,
Aaron Ross, from Salesforce.com, 555-555-5555. Thanks and have a great
day.”
The last message is likely to get you the highest callback rate, since it is
mysterious. I’m not a fan of this last message with new prospects because they
can call you back thinking it’s something important only to find out “Oh it’s a
salesperson,” and leaving a bad taste in their mouth. I suggest using it with
people you’ve already had contact with who could or should recognize your
name. Voicemail can be effective in combination with email.",
3327,Predictable Revenue,"When people do call you
back directly, they’ll often say things like, “I wasn’t going to call you back at
first, but you were so persistent...” or, “Thanks for the reminder, I’ve been
meaning to call you back.…”
Voicemail can be effective in combination with email. Voicemail also lets them hear your voice and helps establish that you’re a real
human, which is why it’s important not to get too mechanical with scripts and
lose the humanity in your voice. Move Prospects Through “Account Status” Assembly Line Stages
You can't predictably create revenue without predictable pipeline, and that
requires ways to measure and track how pipeline gets created. An effective, easy-to-use sales automation or CRM system makes it convenient
now to use a simple idea, the assembly line, as a model to ""manufacture new
pipeline"", implying a sales organization that can measurably, consistently and
predictably produce new sales opportunities.",
3328,Predictable Revenue,"Just as you use stages in your sales process to track movement and progress
through it, you need similar stages in your prospecting process. Also, if you can establish specific actions and methods for dealing with a
prospect depending on which specific stage they are in, you will be far more
effective as a salesperson. Our analogous sales process system for prospecting
stages is called “Account Status.”
These stages are separate and complementary to your sales process stages,
because they precede the creation of a new sales opportunity. Below are the assembly line stages you should use to track how you're moving
prospects through your prospecting process (customize as you see fit):
These “Account Status” settings are the equivalent of sales stages in
opportunities, but specifically for accounts/organizations. So the account is
“cold,” the account is “working,” and so on.",
3329,Predictable Revenue,"It is essential for reps (especially Sales Development Reps who are prospecting
for new business) to be able to organize their accounts in this manner so that reps
can focus on the right accounts with the right messages at the right time, and
minimize wasted efforts. It’s highly embarrassing for your outbound sales team to be sending prospecting
emails or making prospecting calls into your current customers! How To Use These Stages 
Create a new data field in your sales system on the Accounts/Organizations page
or tab called “Account Status,” which is a pick list. Add these eight settings. Test
them out and feel free to customize them to your own language and process. Here are further explanations for the statuses, which you can also think of “Bins”
where you put accounts:
Bin: 1. Cold 
This should be pretty self-evident, but it's accounts where you have no activity,
and no real insight into whether they're a fit or not.",
3330,Predictable Revenue,"Often this bucket consists of
data you've imported from someplace like Jigsaw and unresponsive accounts. Bin: 2. Working 
This bucket includes all the prospects that a rep is actively touching and
researching. A rep has some kind of conversation going on at this account, either
by email or phone. They may not be sure if the company is a good prospect yet,
if there's interest, or even who the right influencers are. The goal of a rep with an account in the ""Working"" status is NOT to generate a
sales opportunity by any means necessary. The primary goal is to determine the
“truth” of whether there is, or is not, an opportunity at this account in the next
several weeks or months. If there isn't, it's better to move on than to generate a
poor opportunity that will distract sales reps from “real” ones. “Nurture” Bin: 3. Active Opportunity 
When a rep generates a new sales opportunity and that opportunity is still alive,
use this status to remove that account from the assembly line.",
3331,Predictable Revenue,"For Sales
Development Reps, it makes it easy to check on the accounts and opportunities
they've passed to their sales rep partners, to make sure no batons got dropped
(which happens more than you'd like). “Nurture” Bin: 4. Check Back Quarterly 
I like status names that speak for themselves :) There's no current opportunity
here, but there should be someday. “Nurture” Bin: 5. Dead Opportunity 
Accounts with a dead sales opportunity are special, and deserve their own
category, because they are highly likely to become customers in the future. “Avoid” Bin: 6. Current Client 
Small companies may not “get” this, but trust me: As your customer base gets
bigger, and the data in your SFA/CRM system gets messier, it's almost
impossible to keep your Sales Development Reps from calling on current
customers. You want to make sure the team prospecting into cold accounts
avoids current customers, and this is a way to help them do that. “Avoid” Bin: 7.",
3332,Predictable Revenue,"Bad Fit 
No business fit, or perhaps they're out of business. It's a waste of time to ever
talk to this company. “Avoid” Bin: 8. Duplicate Account
Sometimes you don't want to delete an account or lead. By marking it duplicate,
you can make sure you avoid it in the future. SDR Compensation
I experimented quite a bit with different compensation structures at
Salesforce.com. The best was the simplest with just two components:
A Base salary: $_______
A Commission of $______ (targeted to be about 50% of the base, or 1/3 of their
total)
Depending on where you are in the country, your base, for a quality person,
could range from $35,000,$60,000, and the commission could range from
$20,000,$60,000. The low end compensation would be if you’re hiring new college graduates, and
selling goods with smaller orders—several thousand to $15,000 dollars.",
3333,Predictable Revenue,"The higher compensations are if you’re hiring people with 5 years experience
who are selling premium business-to-business services that cost at least $50,000. Commission Structure
The commission is paid monthly. It is made up of two parts:
50% depends on a goal for the number of qualified opportunities generated
this month. 50% is paid based on deals that close, such as a percentage of revenue. This structure balances short-and long-term goals. It incents Sales Development
Reps to generate many opportunities now, while encouraging them also to focus
on the size of deals and likelihood of closing. SDRs: Account Executives Are Your Customers
Your job as a salesperson is to establish such value with your customers that they
tell everyone they know how good you are and what a fantastic job you’ve done. This is true whether you are a company or an individual. As an SDR, your customers are the Account Executives you support and work
with.",
3334,Predictable Revenue,"Make them successful, and they will make you successful. Your customers are always your greatest assets. Example Simplified Training Plan For A New SDR

Prospecting and Sales Best Practices
A collection of tips and tricks that any salesperson can use to improve results. A “Day in the Life” (SDR Example)
How intentional are you in designing your day, or the days of your salespeople? Here is an example of an “ideal day” in the life of a Sales Development Rep. You can take the principles behind it and design your own “ideal day” templates
for other roles in your company. Free gift: download this ""Day In The Life Template"" from:
www.PredictableRevenue.com/templates
In this case, the first half of the day is primarily for following up on new and
past leads, although perhaps the most important five minutes is in the beginning,
when the SDR considers their “3 goals for the day”. In summary, the most effective days begin with prioritizing key goals for the
day, then a morning of responding to leads (""important and urgent"" work), and
and afternoon of calls and preparation for the future (""important, not urgent""
work).",
3338,Predictable Revenue,"After lunch, the day is blocked out to focus on scheduled calls and demos and
planning. Lastly, the SDR sends out an evening email campaign so that they
have fresh responses waiting in their inbox in the morning. Maintaining Enthusiasm
Finally, to maintain sustainable and positive sales energy in the team, it's
important for sales reps to take breaks every 90 minutes, take a full lunch with
coworkers, and pick a time of day to commit to stopping work (such as 6pm). Overwork can produce more results in the short-term, but will eventually grind
out anyone's ""authentic enthusiasm"" and create burn out and turnover in the
team. The Top Six Prospecting Mistakes Reps Make
1. Expecting Instant Results 
When targeting companies that have multiple people involved in decisions (often
a couple hundred employees and up), it can take 2-4 weeks, or longer, just to
develop a new qualified opportunity. 2.",
3339,Predictable Revenue,"Writing Long Emails 
Long emails can be hard to process — especially when so many people read
them on mobile phones. Can someone read and respond easily to your email on a
Blackberry? Make it easy for them to respond by asking them a single simple
question. Also in email (or by phone), state simply why you are reaching out—and be
honest! You really don’t need to be tricky. The truth is the most persuasive form
of marketing. 3. Going Wide, Not Deep 
Hitting 100 accounts once instead of 10 accounts 10 times each. 4. Giving Up Too Quickly At Ideal Targets
Don’t give up on working to understand if there is a fit or not until you get a
“no” from the real decision maker. Be “pleasantly persistent.”
5. Not Giving Up Quickly Enough At Non-Ideal Targets 
Persistence is valuable, but is a double-edged sword. Being persistent with
prospects that aren’t a good fit is a waste of time. 6.",
3340,Predictable Revenue,"Depending On Activity Metrics Rather Than A Proven Process
“Dials per day” isn’t nearly as useful as tracking “call conversations per day” or
“appointments per week”. What’s your step-by-step process and waterfall? Measure results that are proven to lead to revenue rather than throwing lots of
activity at a goal. My Favorite Prospecting Questions
Here are my personal favorite sales questions to open and start great
conversations with people you don’t know:
“Did I catch you at a bad time?”
This is my all-time favorite question for opening any conversation. In fact, I have
a whole page about it a bit later here in the book. By asking “did I catch you at a bad time,” you are showing your respect for their
time by asking permission to chat. It takes them off the defensive. It
demonstrates that you’re not a sales jackass. More often than not, they’ll say, “It’s not a good time, but how can I help
you?”…and then go ahead and chat with you for 10-15 minutes!",
3341,Predictable Revenue,"May I ask how your [sales teams | marketing organization | research
efforts…] is organized? People like to talk about their business. It’s harder to begin with a “What are
your top challenges?” question, because a) they don’t trust you yet, and b) they
may not have thought about their challenges. Give them an easy question to
answer, such as, “May I ask how your marketing organization (search engine
efforts, recruiting process, etc.) is structured?”
Using an open-ended question encourages them to talk about it and get warmed
up, to start thinking of challenges. Also, sharing the structure or process of a part
of their business will be easy for them (not requiring much thinking), and will
give you excellent situational information on their business. This is an excellent follow-up question after you tell them, honestly and directly,
why you’re calling (“I’m doing some research on your company to determine if
we’re a fit or not…”).",
3342,Predictable Revenue,"If you were me, how would you approach your organization? A great question after you’ve talked with someone who’s helpful, but not the
right person at that company. Do you have your calendar handy? Never schedule by email if you can help it. Get on the calendar (whether it’s for
yourself or you’re setting an appointment up for someone else) right there while
you’re on the phone! 7 Quick Prospecting Tricks
1. Call/Email High: Rather than going directly to your target, call above them
and get referred down to the right person. 2. Attitude: You’re a nonthreatening researcher, not a pushy salesperson. Favorite Questions (useful by phone or email):
(Phone only): “Did I catch you at a bad time?“
""Who is the right person to talk to about _____?""
""May I ask how your ___ [team/process/function] [is structured/works]
today?""
“Would it be a waste of time to discuss ____ to see if we could help?""
3. Think “Bite-sized Emails”:
Keep it short and sweet! Assume emails are read on Blackberries.",
3343,Predictable Revenue,"Ask one (and only one) question per email… keep it simple. 4. If They Aren’t Interested, Find Out Why:
Is (whatever problem you solve) just not a priority? No budget? Organizational change has the place in chaos right now? Is it worth your time to dig more, or should you move on? This insight is important because you will learn if the blocks are objections
to overcome, or what and when your next step should be. 5. Don’t Give Up Too Easily! (With Ideal Prospects):
With ideal prospects, don’t disqualify them until you get a “no” from the
decision maker (don’t take “no” from others, even other executives). If you
sell to the VP Sales and feel the account is ideal, don’t assume that because
the CIO says you’re wasting your time that you are. As Winston Churchill said, “Never, never, never, never give up!” (with ideal
prospects). 6. Always Set Up a Next Step 
What next step will both help your process and create value for the
prospect?",
3344,Predictable Revenue,"Always frame a next step in a way that is valuable to them: “The
best way for us to save time…”; “Here’s how I can help you get to a
decision faster…”; “Your team will learn….”
About one out of four prospects will have had a strong opinion on the next
step they wanted to take. In that case they'll often say, “I need to see a
demo.” If you have a different idea about what you want, don’t fight them. Take their next step with them, and “enhance” their idea with what you
want: “I’d be happy to set up a demo. As part of that preparation process,
it’ll help make our time much more productive if you fill out these five
questions….”
The other 75% of prospects will look to you to suggest the best next step. You’re there to walk them through an evaluation and buying process.",
3345,Predictable Revenue,"So be
prepared to have one or two specific suggestions based on what’s been most
efficient for your other clients: “What we’ve found as a best next step is
to…”

questions"" that work in your market. Put them into a cheat sheet that you can use

One of my favorite time management practices—one that works for any sales
rep or CEO—is to map out three-to-five main goals for the coming day. I like
doing it the night before. Ask yourself, “If I could only get three things done today, what would they be?”
It’s harder than you think to get three important things done! Examples of sales
daily goals (keep them simple):

Sales Best Practices
Shorten sales cycles. Increase sales productivity. Sell To Success
Selling the Predictable Revenue way is about ""Selling To Success."" It's about
hiring and training salespeople who are totally committed to their company's
vision and values. It's salespeople helping new prospects connect with that
vision, and then helping these new customers succeed, and generating lots of
revenue as a byproduct. These salespeople don't close customers that aren't a good long-term fit.",
3348,Predictable Revenue,"They
work with a team of other great salespeople, all helping each other improve and
learn as a team. Compensation is important, but it’s not the most important thing. Traditional “ABC” Selling
People from old school sales mindsets live by ""Always Be Closing!"" They
destructively compete with coworkers. They close wrong-fit customers. They
sell just to get paid, and that's almost the only reason they stay in the job. ""ABC
Selling"" skips two essential steps: creating a Success Plan before negotiating an
agreement, and focusing on Ongoing Customer Success after the close. What Makes “Closing” So Artificial
Salespeople get paid to close deals, and they tend to be pressured, I mean
managed, by fear. Fear is the conventional sales management tool of choice. Ever seen the Glengarry Glen Ross ""Always Be Closing!"" sales motivation
speech? It's extreme, but there are grains of truth in there.",
3349,Predictable Revenue,"When anyone gets paid to do something, and has managers breathing down their
neck, it distorts behavior. Empathy with prospects is lost in the push to ""Just
close the deal!"" Trusting, capable managers can help protect their salespeople
from these distorting effects by focusing on doing the right thing; fear-driving
managers exacerbate the problem. The result: powerful incentives to sell high-value services like a late night cable
TV guy. ""Buy now and get a month-end discount!"" (By the way, to prospects
getting time pressured: Don’t you realize you can get the same discount next
month?)
Is the high pressure you’re applying today generating short-term results at the
expense of long-term results or client/employee trust? What Customers Care About (And It Ain’t Your Sale)
Customers don't care at all whether you close the deal or not. They care about
improving their business. It’s easy to forget this in the heat of a sales cycle. Okay, yes, you know that—but do you live it?",
3350,Predictable Revenue,"Do you remember it? You or your
team probably isn’t selling this way. This idea is constantly driven out of salespeople's heads by the pressure of
commissions, quotas and stress. Reminding them (and their managers) requires
constant reinforcement. Sell Past The Close With A “Success Plan”
Sell “past the close” to the prospect's own vision of their success—however they
define it. Help them define it for themselves. Success is not when your service is
launched; it's when your service is successfully impacting the customer's
business, such as when your software is adopted (not just deployed). Push Selling vs. Pull Selling
A benefit of selling this way is to begin to pull prospects through a buying cycle,
rather than pushing them through a sales cycle. Not only is it a pain to push a
prospect through a sales cycle, it tends to be a lot less productive, and you end
up with more customers who aren't a great long-term fit for the company.",
3351,Predictable Revenue,"Selling to success helps pull a prospect through a buying cycle by helping tie
their goals and desires to your company's ability to help achieve their goals. The Trick
One of the tricks in “selling to success” is to not care too much about the close. Caring too much about the close will cause you to give off subconscious signals
to the customer that you really don't care about their success, you care more
about getting paid or getting your manager off your back. That's the irony of stressing too much about the close itself: the stress can reduce
the likelihood of it happening. The Close Becomes A Natural Step In Achieving The Vision
If you and the customer create a joint vision around how your company will
make them successful, and they believe you, then the close becomes just a
logical step in the progression to achieve that dream. You can remove the
artificiality of “closing,” and make it feel natural.",
3352,Predictable Revenue,"Two Steps To Help Your Team Sell To Success
First: Include a SIMPLE “Success Plan” step before you close. This is a plan
(almost a vision) that paints a picture of the basic steps beyond deployment to
actual client success. It should also include a definition of what success means to
the client, a few key milestones, and some responsibilities of both your company
and the client. This “plan” can literally be a half dozen bullet points in an email, agreed on with
the client. It should be simple enough so that anyone at the client company who
sees it will quickly grasp its essence and vision. Do not create a complex plan. The more clear the client's vision of their success, the more they’ll want to pull
the deal forward on their own. Second: What is your plan for a client’s ongoing success? Do you have a role in
your company dedicated solely to helping customers become successful in using
your product or service?",
3353,Predictable Revenue,"It’s easy to want to push all the responsibility for
success onto the customer, but it is equally your responsibility to help them
succeed, because happy customers will help your business. It’s both the right and
the profitable thing to do. 9 Ways You Lengthen Your Sales Cycles
A never-ending goal of companies is, “How can we shorten sales cycles?” There
are no silver bullets. But there are some patterns around what lengthens cycles
and how to shorten them. While I could come up with a million-and-one issues that delay cycles, here are
the eight main ones to look into first. 1) Wrong Prospects, Poor Messaging (Square Peg / Round Hole)
It takes longer than you want to nail your market and messaging. Companies sell
to the wrong people and companies ALL THE TIME.",
3354,Predictable Revenue,"Or they sell to the right
people with language that sounds good and fancy to investors, but means
nothing to prospects (“We are the leading social graph platform integration
appliance blah blah blah….”)
It’s human nature—you want more customers, and you get desperate anytime
anyone gives you a sign of interest. (I’ll refrain from making the soobvious
dating analogy here.)
“Pick a niche, get rich.” If your marketing and sales efforts aren’t focused on
your Ideal Customers, you will spend way too much time and energy on
prospects who don’t really need what you have to offer (or they don’t understand
yet why they need it). 2) No Sales Process
Do you have a sales process? If you don’t—get one. ANYTHING is better than
no process. A consistent process that isn’t working well is better than no process,
because you can improve consistent systems—you can’t improve random
systems. 3) You Have A Fantastic But Unused Sales Process
You have a great sales process but still struggle.",
3355,Predictable Revenue,"Do your reps actually follow the
process? Is it simple? (Complexity reduces adoption). How is it supposed to
work in the trenches? Have you customized the process to your specific
business? When was the last time you sat down with a rep or reps and watched
or listened or asked about what they really do each day, and how effective it is? 4) “Selling Selfishly” Rather Than “Solving”
Are your reps just pushing deals and “selling,” or are they proving to the clients
that they can help solve problems? Do your reps disqualify? (Reps that just “sell
sell sell” don’t disqualify enough). Can reps, as described in the prior section on
“Selling To Success,” create a clear vision that empowers and pulls clients into
really wanting what you have to offer? 5) Selling Too Low
Find out early who has influence and approval power—who’s involved in the
sale? Yes, I know, this isn’t revolutionary—but reps don’t do this. REPS DO
NOT DO THIS.",
3356,Predictable Revenue,"They are afraid to ask because they’re intimidated by executives
and they’re afraid bold questions will derail their deal. Sales reps tend to spend
time with the people at a prospect that are willing to spend time with them (it’s
easier). In pipeline reviews or one-on-one coaching sessions, be merciless in
finding out how much energy reps are putting into mapping out decision-
making processes and people. If they aren’t directly in touch with decision makers, how can they help
their Champion or main point of contact sell for them? (Never assume your
internal champion knows how to or can sell internally for you!)
When doing outbound sales, start high—one or two levels higher than your
decision maker. Have reps practice role-playing with people at your company that can think
and speak like decision-makers. It will give the reps confidence, and teach
them how to have better conversations with senior people. How can you position your product and marketing to resonate and sell
higher?",
3357,Predictable Revenue,"6) Poor Understanding Of The Prospect’s Buying Process (Or What It
Takes To Close This Deal)
Ask the prospects how their buying process works. Every company has their
own buying quirks. Don’t be afraid to probe. The better you understand how
their process works, the more effectively you can help them figure out if your
product is a fit or not. If your prospect (or market) has an average six-month buying process, there’s no
point in getting impatient at month three. What’s your usual process to evaluate and buy products like this?”
What would it take to close in [30/60/90] days? (Or by a certain date)
How can we get this done?” (Later in a sales cycle)
When asking bold questions, it’s not what you ask, it’s how you ask it. If you ask
a question like, “How can we get this done?” in an insecure way, it will hurt you. Ask it easily and confidently, and it can close the deal for you. 7) Not Caring About Them 
Do you really want to help them improve their business, or just sell them stuff?",
3358,Predictable Revenue,"Great salespeople focus on making their prospects successful. How can you help
your prospects, even if there’s no direct connection to a sale yet? Are their
resources, news, advice, referrals or other things of value you can share with
them? When you call, do you authentically care about how their business is
going, or are you just focused on finding out if they’re ready to buy yet? Focusing on their success builds trust, which leads to more sales. 8) Telling Instead Of Showing (How Can You Prove It?)
If you’re still working on breaking into an account, or have a stagnant prospect,
try giving them something for free that will be valuable to them, like a free trial. Instead of telling them how great you are, or what a leader your company is,
how can you prove it? For example, a trial can create a first point of entry in the
“getting to know you” stage and give buyers a taste that you have the credibility
to help them. Don’t just throw free stuff at them.",
3359,Predictable Revenue,"Tailor what you’re offering to
whatever their needs or problems are, or else it’s likely to be a waste of time for
both parties. 9) Dragging Your Feet In Disqualifying
I love Tom Batchelder’s book titled Barking Up A Dead Horse (and I
recommend it!). Because of desperation, pressure or a lack of clarity on their
“Ideal Customer Profile,” executives and salespeople will beat dead or poor-fit
opportunities to death, simply because that opportunity is in front of them, and
it's easier to whip it than to go looking for new ones. Every month, go in and
clear your pipeline clutter to create space for new, high quality opportunities! Obsess About the Decision Making Process, Not The Decision
Maker
In the past, Sales was ALL about the decision maker, and everyone else on their
team wasn’t thought of as important.",
3360,Predictable Revenue,"Now, because executives are busier than ever, and because business culture is
more collaborative and less dictatorial, decision makers rely more and more on
their teams to help them make purchase decisions. In the past, when decision makers would defer salespeople to their subordinates,
it was because the decision maker didn’t think it was important or valuable, and
wanted to blow salespeople off. Salespeople were rightly trained to fight to get around this objection and obtain
the decision makers’ time no matter what.",
3361,Predictable Revenue,"Now, the “decision making process” is more important than “the decision
maker.”
Avoid questions like:
“Who is the decision maker?”
“Who signs the check?”
Ask questions like:
“How have you evaluated similar products or services?”
“What is the decision making process?”
“Who is involved in making the decision?”
“How will the decision be made?”
“What are the steps to have a check cut or funds released?”
Now, when a decision maker refers you to their “get it done” people (the
influencers), it’s a perfectly good way to begin selling into an account. Should you ignore decision makers early on? No! In other words, sales reps shouldn't wimp out and avoid trying to build a
relationship with the decision maker, but it’s not always urgent to get there from
the beginning (though it is a big help). Is reaching the ultimate decision makers any less important? No! Win over your internal champions and coaches first; build the case.",
3362,Predictable Revenue,"Then you’ll
be perfectly positioned to win over the final decision makers. You do want to build a relationship with the decision makers early, but don’t
“sell” them until you’ve begun winning over the influencers, or at least until
they’ve begun to agree with the value of your business case. Build some
credibility and understanding of the business first. You’ll look weak, lame or‘sales-y’ if you’re pitching a business case to the
decision maker that their influencers disagree with or don’t fully buy into yet. Finally, when a salesperson doesn’t understand the decision-making process
(which is all too common!), there’s a lot less visibility into how long the sale can
take, the likelihood of closing, and hidden landmines. Busy salespeople tend not to ask enough (or bold enough) questions of prospects
around how the prospect’s internal processes work. If you’re a salesperson: With your current top five deals, how well have you
mapped out their internal buying process?",
3363,Predictable Revenue,"If you’re a sales executive: If you sat down with your team and had them talk
about their own top deals, how clear are they, not just on the current status of the
deal or the next step, but also the prospect’s actual internal process to get to a
decision? 9 Steps To Create Free Trials That Maximize Conversion Rates
These principles are written for sales rep-driven free trials (where the reps are
coordinating and negotiating the free trial as part of a sales cycle), but you can
also apply the principles to online self-managed trials. 1. Design The Trial With Your Prospect (And Help Them Run It). You’ll see this as a theme in all the following points. Don’t just throw or push a
trial on a prospect. Instead, how can you enroll them in wanting it, defining
success, running it and growing it? You have to help them make it successful. Help them help themselves. 2. Do Your Best To Understand The Prospect’s True Business Issues Before
You Begin. Sounds like a no-brainer, right?",
3364,Predictable Revenue,"Except that reps are so eager to jump into a
demo or get a free trial going that they frequently don’t prepare enough. Also,
prospects frequently aren’t very clear on what they want—especially if you’re
dealing with multiple influencers and users. Without the homework of really
understanding their challenges and desires, you can’t begin with the end in mind
and design the trial for success. 3. Agree With The Prospect On Where The Free Trial Fits In Their Buying
Process (Or Your Selling Process). A free trial is just one part of a longer (but hopefully not too much longer!) sales
or buying cycle. If the trial is successful, then what? Answer that question before
you begin the trial. 4. Better To Nail Fewer (Or A Single) Key Problems Than Try To Solve
Every Problem For Everyone. The trial will only be a success if the prospect gets value and knows it. Everyone
is busy, so pick your battle. Where can you show the biggest bang-for-the-buck?",
3365,Predictable Revenue,"(In this case, “buck” means the prospect's time and attention.) What would be
the easiest place to prove success? Build fast wins early and then add features
over time. “If we could only solve 1-3 things with this trial, what would they
be?”
5. Define With The Client What A “Successful Trial” Means. How will the client (including the decision maker) know the trial is a success? Map this out with the client before you begin. Don’t be afraid to ask the client
questions like, “What does success look like? What do we [you and the prospect]
need to accomplish with the trial before you want to move forward with us?”
6. Create Milestones For The Trial. Lay out a plan with regular milestones. Hitting milestones creates momentum
and creates more proof of value. Keep them simple, such as “80% of users take
training in Week 1”; “Three executive dashboards built”; or, “50 leads generated
and accepted.” Don’t be afraid to update or change milestones along the way.",
3366,Predictable Revenue,"Always have a next goal or milestone for the prospect to be working towards! 7. Enroll The Prospect (And Their Team). Just because a prospect agrees to do a free trial and makes a plan doesn’t mean
they are going to follow through—especially if your contact hasn’t sold their
internal people on it yet. Make sure the customer has the right expectations of
how much time and effort they need to put into the trial to make it succeed. Tip:
have them pre-schedule time or activities (including checkins with you) into
their calendar for a few weeks in advance: “Let’s schedule this now, so that you
don’t have to worry about it later.”
8. Simplify The Trial Process 
How can you make the trial as simple and easy as possible for the client? Do you
have a step-by-step system, instructions or training for them? Don’t make them
think. Paralysis comes with complexity. Make it as simple as you can for them to
succeed. 9.",
3367,Predictable Revenue,"Set Expectations 
Most 
success 
comes 
from 
expectations—did 
you 
over-promise 
and
underdeliver? Or vice versa? Expectations are incredibly powerful, and can
make or break trust with your prospect… and hence the sale. A 3-Hour-and-15-Minute Sales Process
Just as important as sales cycle length is how many hours of selling time per rep
does each sales cycle require? How can they be much more efficient and
effective, in order to handle more deals with higher close rates? Reps tend to waste a LOT of time chasing early and stalled deals (“Hi Bob, just
checking in to see if anything’s changed yet over there. It hasn’t? OK, I’ll call
you again in two weeks…”)
Also, Bob here in the example might be someone without much power or
influence, and no matter how long the rep persists, nothing’s ever going to
happen. My “3-Hour-and-15-Minute” Sales Process is a big help in the early stages of a
sales cycle to qualify it, get access to decision makers and build a common
vision.",
3368,Predictable Revenue,"It’s also very simple. I developed it when I began doing sales consulting,
to minimize the amount of time both parties needed to figure out whether or not
we should work together, and when. The objectives of this process are to qualify or disqualify early, gain access to the
multiple people in a deal that have power, and begin creating a common vision
with the prospect. There are three steps that add up to three hours and fifteen minutes of total time
invested to get to the point that both parties know there’s a good fit and when is
the right time to engage (even if that is not today). Step 1: (15 Minutes) First Contact: “Is This A Waste Of Time?” 
Imagine you are referred to someone, or get a response from a prospect and have
a first chat with them. You can take fifteen minutes with them to figure out
whether or not it’s a waste of time to speak further.",
3369,Predictable Revenue,"Frankly, everyone’s so busy and overwhelmed these days that they appreciate
being told what to do, so that they don’t have to think. In this first call, start
setting expectations right away. Lay out your process for the prospect in the best
way to mutually figure out the fit, and position it in a way that benefits them. “We’ve found the best way to quickly figure out if there’s a real fit or not takes
just two steps: first, a more in-depth 'discovery' call with yourself and any other
people you want to bring in. And then if that call goes well, a follow-up group
whiteboarding session or call with the key people on your team who’d be
involved, so that we can flesh it out all at once if, how and when we should work
together.”
Step 2: (One Hour) Qualification / Discovery Call: “Is There A Fit?” 
This is a call with one or two of the prospect’s point people, the ones that usually
check out new vendors.",
3370,Predictable Revenue,"They want see if they like you and what you’re doing
enough to spend more time on your company and introduce you to more people
involved in their evaluation. You are qualifying or disqualifying them as well—remember, if it’s not a good
fit, you should move on! Your goal, if there is a fit, is to create a plan with the
prospect to organize a working or whiteboarding session that brings in their key
people and decision makers, to meet with and create a vision with your key
people. It’s not always realistic to do this with every prospect, but it isn’t as hard as you
might think. The more confidently you can layout your process, and why it
works for them, too (which it does!), the more likely they’ll follow along. Do they really want you bugging them for months about whether there’s a fit? Why not just figure it out now? Step 3: (Two Hours) Group Working Session: “Should We Work Together?”
In this session, you want to create a joint vision together.",
3371,Predictable Revenue,"Walk them through a
design process on how they can and will become successful with your product. Coach the vision out of them rather than telling it to them. It’s fine to use slides for introductions and to set the context, but move to
whiteboards quickly. Whiteboards allow both sides as a team to easily create
something together in real-time! If you’re on the phone, of course it’s more challenging—but conceptually again
set the stage and boundaries of the call, and help the client create a compelling
and achievable vision with you that pulls them forward. Killer Salespeople Uncover True Problems Behind Desired
Solutions
When asking prospects about their challenges, their pain, they will usually in
fact actually tell you their desired solutions, which sound like problems: “We
need a new marketing system,” or, “Our marketing system is dysfunctional,” is
not a true problem, it’s a solution masked as a problem.",
3372,Predictable Revenue,"What they are really
saying is, “We want a new marketing system.”
This isn’t because they are hedging—often they just haven’t thought about the
root source of their problems. In other words, prospects usually don’t know what
their underlying problems are, and you must help them determine what they are. Here is a sample of how asking “Why?” or, “Why is that important?” or, “So
what?” can lead you to the true business problem:
“We need to integrate our financial and sales systems.” That is a desired
solution, not a pain or challenge… Why? “Because our reporting is inaccurate.” Still not a root challenge yet… Why? “Because our executive has presented reports to the CFO that later turned
out to be wrong.”
Aha! Now that is a real pain: unable to make effective plans or business
decisions because of inaccurate reporting. The challenge of determining these true problems is tough for sales reps who
aren’t practiced at it.",
3373,Predictable Revenue,"Do regular role-playing in your sales teams to improve the
team’s skills, and play devil’s advocate. Give them lots of solutions that sound
like problems, and challenge them to dig the true problems out of you. Prospects Should Earn Proposals
Does your sales team give out proposals and quotes like one of those people
standing on the street handing out flyers? “Here, please take one!”
There is a cost to giving out proposals or paperwork too soon—the prospect
doesn’t value it or your time, and you lose the chance to set up a specific next
step that would help them earn the proposal. Example:
You do a demo. Atthe end of the demo, they ask about pricing or a proposal. You say you’ll include a proposal with a follow up email. They say, “Thanks”. You send the materials. You never hear from them again. Giving out proposals too easily helps no one — though it might feel good to
think, “Sent out another proposal today!” Great—but how many are you getting
back?",
3374,Predictable Revenue,"If you’re not winning at least 50% of the proposals you’re giving out, you’re too
easy. Instead, next time when the prospect casually asks about pricing or getting a
proposal, don’t give it to them until you know they want it. Tell them you’d be
happy to, and to do that, you’d need to set up a scoping call with them and the
key people, to ensure the proposal is accurate and meets their needs. If the prospect declines—then either they aren’t a great prospect, or you didn’t
prove your value to them in your prior calls or demos. If the prospect wants what you have, now you have another chance to focus your
time with them and the other key people on creating a vision of how you can
specifically solve their problems… and generate a proposal that nails it for them. If this scares you at first, just try it. You’ll see the balance of power shift from
being totally uneven and in their favor, to being more of a mutual balance.",
3375,Predictable Revenue,"My Favorite Sales Call Question Of All Time
I’ve always been irritated by meaningless questions like “How are you doing
today?” I mean, does the person asking actually care or not? And getting called
can feel like a violation, even when it’s someone you know. This tip is a small but critical detail, which is why it deserves its own section. In
fact, Steel Shaw, who worked for me at Salesforce.com, often said later that this
question was the best sales tip he’d ever learned. Without further adieu, this is the best question ever to use to open calls:
“Did I catch you at a bad time?”
Conversationally, it might be used like this to open a call: “Hi ___, it’s Aaron
from PebbleStorm calling. Hey by the way, did I catch you at a bad time?”
While this question is useful for any call, it is most useful with unscheduled
calls, when the person isn’t expecting you (even if they know you).",
3376,Predictable Revenue,"It helps you make a positive first impression and set the tone of the first two
minutes of the conversation, which then determines the rest of the call (and even
whether you get to have the call at all). When you begin a call with “Did I catch you at a bad time?” you’re asking
permission to chat and putting them at ease; they feel less defensive or violated. It’s much better than “Is this a good time?” (No—it’s never a good time for busy
people). Here’s what will usually happen when you use this question—they’ll say
something like either:
“No, what’s going on?”
“Yes, but I have a minute, how can I help you?”
If they pick up the phone, and it truly is a bad time for them, they’ll say so, and
you have the perfect opportunity to ask, “When would be a better time to talk? Do you have your calendar handy?”
Though I’m not a pushy or controlling person, MAKE YOUR TEAM USE
THIS QUESTION RELIGIOUSLY! 6
Lead Generation and “Seeds, Nets & Spears”
Why do people treat all leads alike?",
3377,Predictable Revenue,"They aren’t created equal! You need to
understand the different types of leads in order to lay a solid foundation for a
predictable sales machine. Distinguishing Leads: “Seeds, Nets and Spears”
I’ve seen incredible confusion and misunderstanding, among CEOs, Marketing
VPs, board members and Sales VPs, around “leads.” The parties lack a shared
understanding around lead types and how to make rational projections, creating
miscommunication, conflict and disagreements. The most common mistake is lumping all the types of leads into one bucket of
“leads,” and then making future projections based on past results. After hearing time and time again about these frustrations, I came up with simple
distinctions between the three fundamentally different kinds of leads: “Seeds,”
“Nets” and “Spears.”
However, different leads have different fundamental attributes: how well they
qualify, how fast they close, ROI, etc.",
3378,Predictable Revenue,"I find that thinking in terms of Seeds, Nets and Spears gives teams a simpler way
to come to a common understanding (and to share this understanding with
investors) of their leads analysis and projections. Seeds take a lot of time to cultivate and to ramp up, but once they get going,
they are unbeatable with the highest conversion and close rates. These include
developing happy customers, organic internet search/SEO, public relations, local
user groups, most social media, publishing expert content. Nets: Nets are classic marketing programs, in which you’re trying to cast a wide
net and see what you get, whether through email marketing, conferences,
advertising, and some forms of internet marketing (PPC). Spears involve targeted outbound efforts (such your classic “hunting”) that
require some individual human efforts (such as business development, “Top 10
Targets” programs, and Cold Calling 2.0).",
3379,Predictable Revenue,"Example “Nets” Marketing Funnel
Example “Spears” Prospecting Funnel
Defining Prospects, Leads, Opportunities, Clients and Champions
Here are my definitions. What is more important than how you define a Lead or
any other term, is that everyone has a shared understanding of that definition. Prospects (or Names)
A database of names or a list that you are marketing to, in which people have not
responded positively yet. If you buy a list of names from a place like InfoUSA, Jigsaw or Hoovers, it is a
list of prospects (or names), not “leads.”
Leads
A lead is a prospect that has responded positively in some way to show their
interest in what you have to offer, such as registering for a white paper or
attending a webinar. Whether or not they are a high-quality lead isn’t the point—
if they’ve registered for something, they are a lead. Opportunities
After someone has qualified a lead through email or the phone, and the lead
meets your set of qualification criteria, it becomes an opportunity.",
3380,Predictable Revenue,"A common
abbreviation is “oppty.”
Clients
They have given you money. Champions
A champion can be a client or non-client that has referred you business, offered a
testimonial, or has actively supported you in any other way. Be sure to give them love! Use “Layers Of The Onion” To Sell For You
More than ever, prospects like to get to know you first before they buy, and they
want to do it on their own terms, and in their own time. Spend any time with me talking about lead generation or sales, and the term
“layers of the onion” or “onion layers” will come up,a lot. I’ve found that this
concept is a great analogy to help teams think through laying out their products
and offers. The goal is to make it easier for prospects to “choose their own adventure” in
how they get to know a company and its products, step-by-step. The Internet has drastically shifted power from sellers to buyers.",
3381,Predictable Revenue,"The old way of
marketing and selling involved pushing information onto prospects and then
working to control their steps along a sales process. Buyers had limited access to information, which they had to negotiate out of
sellers. Now, buyers can do more research on their own before they ever talk to a
human at a company (if they ever do talk to a human!)
Go With It — Let Prospects Do The Work! Instead of resisting this trend and staying attached to how potential customers
used to or “should” get to know your company, go with it and give the prospects
the control over how they want to get to know you. Present them with a couple of logical next steps and let them decide how and
when to move forward (of course, with some helpful reminders now and then if
they’ve stalled). Setting up progressive layers of the onion is key to “receiving sales” or “pulling
sales” (much easier than pushing sales). Let the prospects do the work for you!",
3382,Predictable Revenue,"The Layers Are Mutual — Get To Know The Prospects As They Get To
Know You
The layers enable prospects and vendors to test mutual compatibility with
progressive steps of increasing trust and commitment, to minimize risk and costs
of a bad fit to both parties. With the layers of the onion, a prospect can engage
right away at the level they feel comfortable with, and then can work their way
up the trust and commitment layers as they and you see fit. As a seller, now you can more easily test out how much of a fit the customer is
for you, before you commit extra time or resources to them! Committing to a
bad-fit customer is an enormous cost, and the right layers can help you avoid
those landmines. Let Go
Give up trying to control how long someone takes to move forward. You’ll have
to accept that most prospects who initially sign up for a blog, trial or demo just
won’t be ready to do anything. That’s okay—don’t try to force them.",
3383,Predictable Revenue,"But
consider if there’s another onion layer you can create to offer to make it easier
for them to take another step. Give up trying to control how long someone takes to move forward. If you see prospects getting stuck somewhere in your “layers,” consider
redesigning your next-step offers. What is the next “juicy morsel” they would
want if you showed it to them, that would help them take another step forward? What new layers, content or products can you create that are compelling and
relevant to who the prospect is and where they are in their evaluation and buying
cycle? Let go of trying to control prospects, and trust that if it’s a good mutual fit, and
you keep nurturing them, and your “layers” are relevant and useful, they will
become a customer someday! How To Generate A Steady Flow Of Inbound Leads
The following section was guest-written by Peter Caputa of Hubspot.",
3384,Predictable Revenue,"When
Peter and I first connected, we immediately appreciated each other’s thinking,
and I’m happy to share some great ideas from Peter on ways to generate inbound
leads. Inbound leads are leads that come to you, typically registering on your website
in some way or asking to be called back. They are the ones that find you before
you find them. Inbound leads can be highly erratic, coming in spurts and spikes depending on
the winds of fate and what kinds of PR or advertising your company is doing at
any one time. But there are ways to create more flow and predictability. What Inbound Marketing Methods Work? Each of the activities is ranked in order of its ability to generate leads more
easily:
1. Referrals
2. Free Tools/Free Trials
3. Organic Search Engine Optimization
4. Blogging
5. Email Newsletters
6. Webinars
7. PPC (pay-per-click marketing)
8. Affiliate Marketing
9. Social Media
However, all the activities are complementary and can be hard to separate from
each other.",
3385,Predictable Revenue,"For example, blogging helps SEO and email newsletters. Collectively, they create an inbound marketing strategy in which each piece
complements the others. Also, pretty much every one of these methods is responsible for doing two
important things in inbound marketing. 1. They attract new prospects. 2. They help nurture existing leads. If I were a marketing or sales VP or a small business owner starting inbound
marketing, I wouldn’t leave out any of these. But this stuff doesn’t happen
overnight. Pick three areas first in which to create momentum, before trying to
do them all. Most of these techniques require a time investment instead of a financial
investment. Many of these things support each other. So, it’s important to do
things in the proper order and to prioritize. Referrals 
Your best marketing and source of inbound leads are happy customers. When
customers recommend your product or service to a peer, they’re establishing that
you’re credible and trustworthy.",
3386,Predictable Revenue,"The trust implicit in their relationship with the
prospect they’re referring is transferred to you. On the web, you can accelerate the pace of referrals by “entering the
conversation,” setting the precedent for receiving referrals by giving referrals
(the law of reciprocity: you get more of what you give) and by generally making
yourself available to speak with new people whether there’s an immediate, direct
connection between their need and your service or not. Free Tools/Trials
It’s hard to remember now, but ten years ago, very few software companies
offered free trials. Everyone was worried that competitors would learn too much,
and that salespeople would lose a lot of leverage with prospects. Salesforce.com changed everything as one of the first companies to offer a full
30-day free trial of its service on its website. It became their #1 lead generation
and sales tool!",
3387,Predictable Revenue,"HubSpot’s WebsiteGrader.com is a free SEO and website analysis tool that lets
anyone analyze the effectiveness of their site and online marketing. Marketo has
all kinds of free training and educational resources. Landslide has an online tool
that helps organizations design a sales process for free. Practically every
software-as-a-service company out there has some kind of free trial. If there’s a
way to take a part of your service that is useful by itself and make it free, this
will generate more leads and become your best sales tool. Even if you’re a company that doesn’t sell software, what kind of free trial can
you offer? A free consultation? Free online training videos? Samples of your
work? Sample product? Organic Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
This one takes the most patience, but if it is done right, it is simply a byproduct
of doing everything else right. SEO requires thorough keyword research and
search engine rank monitoring.",
3388,Predictable Revenue,"If you do this well, blogging, public relations and social media can support your
SEO efforts without an expensive SEO consultant, and without a lot of work
dedicated “just” to SEO. The name of the game is to pick keywords, optimize
pages with those keywords (could be blog posts) and build links. The effect of SEO on inbound lead generation is cumulative and compounding. In other words, month after month, as long as you keep creating great content
and building smart links, the number of leads generated from SEO goes up and
up. Blogging 
You must “enter the conversation” (be a part of online discussions) if you’re
going to do inbound marketing. There are so many people who start a blog and
think it’s just about saying smart things or about writing. It’s not. It’s about
having a 2-way conversation. Any good salesperson knows that an effective
prospecting call requires the prospect to be talking more than the salesperson. It’s the same way with a blog.",
3389,Predictable Revenue,"It’s imperative to be a resource for people and to
proactively network with your blog by reading other blogs, linking to other blogs
and leaving comments on other blogs, if you want people to do the same thing
for you. It’s not necessarily the law of reciprocity, but it’s the law of
participation. Set a simple goal, such as meeting one new blogger per week. At some point in the lifetime of a blog, after a critical mass of audience is built,
things begin to pick up on their own. This can take months or, more likely if
you’re new, years. Subscribers come out of nowhere, links come from nowhere,
random people repost or forward on your blog posts and send a flood of traffic. After a while, you can just focus on creating great content and hosting a great
conversation on your blog. Email And Lead Nurturing
Permission-based direct email marketing is still THE most important marketing
technique both to develop new leads and nurture old ones.",
3390,Predictable Revenue,"Email marketing is
important to establish your expertise, build relationships and trust with your
audience, promote your webinars or live events, and promote your products. At a minimum, all you need your email system to do is share your blog posts via
email and to invite people to events or webinars you’re holding. Are people even visiting your blog? How many people remember to check your
blog anyway without a reminder? Make it easy on them and drop it in their
inbox. As a rule of thumb, send out an email at least once per month, and no
more than 2x per week. Webinars
Webinars are a great lead nurturing practice. Webinars get them coming back
and interacting and learning from you, and offer an easy and compelling reason
to spread the word to their friends about what you’re doing. Webinars are a great lead nurturing practice. 80% of webinars are not for selling but for teaching: TEACH people something
useful in the webinar. How can you help them do their jobs better?",
3391,Predictable Revenue,"Webinars establish credibility and communicate what you do in an educational
and neutral setting. Webinars are especially valuable as part of a series, where
people know to keep looking for the next piece of your story and can tell their
friends about it, too. Make webinars “bigger than you”—make them about the
attendees, not your company. An ideal format: hold webinars in which customers
are the presenters, and they are sharing with your audience lessons learned in
your area of expertise. Some of these lessons are related to your product, and
some lessons are not. “Pay Per Click” (PPC) Marketing
Pay Per Click Advertising can be a very effective lead generation tool. Some
business-to-business companies with simple products or services use PPC as
their sole or primary online marketing activity. However, companies selling sophisticated products and services tend to have
mixed results with PPC.",
3392,Predictable Revenue,"The more trust-building and education your prospects
need, the less likely PPC leads will convert into customers. Studies conducted have shown that less-educated people tend to click on pay-
per-click ads, while more-educated people click on organic search results. While PPC sometimes can be a source of leads-on-demand, be careful to track
their quality in terms of conversion rates to qualified opportunities and to closed
deals. If you’re selling to more sophisticated buyers, you’ll be better served with
focusing on SEO and blogging as your primary activities, and using PPC in
experimental ways as you figure out the best online marketing mix. Affiliate Marketing / Joint Ventures
If you’re at a phase of maturity in your marketing where you know who your
ideal prospects are, you can identify publications (i.e. forums, blogs, trade
magazines, email lists, vertical search engines) that have relevant audiences of
those types of prospects.",
3393,Predictable Revenue,"The best partners are bloggers or companies with large and trusting email
audiences, and whose interests and values align with yours. Better than buying
lists from them is placing a compelling offer on a targeted site or in their email
newsletter. Even more ideal: you can partner with them on a (disclosed) pay-for-
performance basis, in which they help promote your company in exchange for a
pay-per-lead or percentage-of-revenue basis. Both partners win this way: the blogger/organization creates value for their
audience and earns extra income or revenue, and the company generates leads or
sells product. Social Media 
Online networking, social media and social bookmarking sites are great tools to
support blog readership growth and to support search engine rankings. But I’ve
found that the ROI from social media isn’t cumulative or compounding when
used in isolation - unless you’re already famous.",
3394,Predictable Revenue,"I do think it’s a very important part of an inbound marketing mix as it adds a
human face to your company. However, it does not immediately drive a lot of
direct traffic that converts into leads. Social media can also be extremely powerful if a sales and marketing team
coordinates some social media marketing activities and leverages the distributed
team’s personal networks to launch a product, get feedback and raise awareness
about a campaign. Sites like LinkedIn and Twitter also make it a bit easier to
initially connect with a prospect or lead who seems immune to voicemails and
emails. Do Fewer Things, Better 
Do not try to do everything at once! Pick two or three of the above options to
begin with and focus on first, building some expertise, momentum and results,
before beginning to add more activities. Beware of scattering your energy in too
many directions and projects at any one time.",
3395,Predictable Revenue,"Marketing Automation Best Practices: “How Marketo Uses
Marketo”
When you want to learn how to do something really well, where do you go? To
the master! When I wanted to learn how to build the best sales organization possible, I knew
where to go: working in sales at Salesforce.com. While I was there, I saw first
hand how effective the sales organization became, in large part because
Salesforce.com was an expert at developing and using its own product to push
the boundaries of sales best practices. For this book, as a complement to the sales best practices, I wanted to share
some modern marketing automation best practices. For that, where better to go
than to the marketing department of a hot marketing automation company,
Marketo? They’ve grown from nothing to more than 500 customers in just a
handful of years. Marketo’s marketing automation solution, “Marketo Lead Management”, helps
marketers automate and measure demand generation campaigns.",
3396,Predictable Revenue,"They tie
together a variety of functions like email marketing, lead nurturing and lead
scoring. Generating leads is half the battle. To help sales make the most of leads,
Marketo’s second product (“Sales Insight”) helps salespeople understand,
prioritize and interact with the hottest leads and opportunities. I wanted to know how Marketo uses their own Marketo product, because they’re
experts at using their own product to push marketing automation best practices. In 2007, when I was at Alloy Ventures, I met Phil Fernandez (CEO) and Jon
Miller (VP Marketing) of Marketo. Since then, I’ve been impressed at their
marketing execution and expertise. I believe in what they’re doing, and Marketo
has also become a partner, client and sponsor of my “Predictable Revenue”
work, including this book. They were generous enough to share some step-by-step inside secrets on what
works for them.",
3397,Predictable Revenue,"How Marketo Efficiently Nurtures, Scores And Delivers Tons Of
Qualified Leads To Sales
Let’s begin with…
The Big Picture: Marketo’s “Revenue Funnel”
Marketo’s revenue funnel is a visualization of how a prospect typically moves
through a buying cycle. They’ve mapped out at a high level the stages at which
prospects go from “nothing” to “customer.”
Marketo’s funnel has six stages: Awareness, Inquiry, Prospect, Lead,
Opportunity and, ultimately, Customer. This book addresses the first four stages,
“Awareness” through “Lead.”
Throughout the entire process, Marketo uses its product to track the behaviors
and actions of its prospects. Here’s Marketo’s funnel diagram:
Let’s walk through their marketing steps (Awareness, Inquiry, Prospect, and
Lead) one-by-one. Stage 1. “Awareness”
Awareness is when the prospect first discovers the company. At this point in the
first four stages, the lead is typically anonymous—that is, Marketo doesn’t know
their name or any contact information.",
3398,Predictable Revenue,"And yet Marketo still tracks activity
levels at this stage. For example:
The primary way Marketo tracks “Awareness Activity” levels is by a) observing
the number of known or anonymous leads that are visiting the site, or b)
searching for the keyword, “Marketo.”
Marketo 
believes 
that 
their 
“Modern 
B2B 
Marketing” 
blog
(http://blog.marketo.com) is the main reason the market’s awareness of them
grew so quickly and greatly sped up how fast they landed their first 500
customers. This is a really important lesson about blogging and marketing: Marketo doesn’t
“pitch” their own products on the blog. There’s no selling. Marketo’s blog is
popular and successful because they provide a platform to share all kinds of
modern marketing best practices and thought leadership. They invite all kinds of
other thought leaders to share on their blog (I’ve been a guest writer). They’ve
become a trusted authority.",
3399,Predictable Revenue,"Creating a company blog is a great way to establish brand presence, drive SEO
rankings and give prospects and partners an easy way to get to know and trust
your company. It is a place to prove your company as a thought leader in your
vertical or industry. Your blog is not the best place to directly promote your business or service. When people get real value from your blog (and events, newsletter and
webinars), they will both come back to buy and refer friends. Stage 2. “Inquiry”
This is the stage when an anonymous lead becomes known by registering with a
name and an email address (that’s it!) They’ve now signed up to receive updates
from Marketo. Most of Marketo’s website content is open and free to read without having to
register. Only certain premium content and research papers require a prospect to
fill out a registration form. People hesitate to register even for free content when
they first find you, before they get to know you even a little bit.",
3400,Predictable Revenue,"Even when they begin asking for someone’s information, Marketo has a neat
capability of “progressive profiling”: instead of asking someone to fill out a big
long form (reducing conversion rates), Marketo can ask for information bit by
bit as someone registers for different pieces of content. This makes it easier for a prospect to trust the company in small steps while the
company continues to learn more about the prospect. The first time a prospect
registers, they might be asked to share only their name and email address. The
next time the prospect downloads a new piece of content, the forms are pre-filled
and can ask for additional information such as title and company. Stage 3. “Prospect”
Now we’re getting into an area where language is critical. The definitions of
“Prospect” vs. “Lead” are especially important to prevent confusion across sales
and marketing. Marketo differentiates “prospects” (colder) from “leads” (warmer).",
3401,Predictable Revenue,"Why: it is
highly inefficient to evenly spread sales’ time across all leads. Marketo wants to
prioritize where its sales team spends its time on lead follow up. They tell them apart by the “lead score,” which rates how hot or not someone is,
on a scale of 1 to 100. Potential buyers with fewer than 65 points are called “prospects”; potential
buyers with more than 65 points are called “leads” — the higher the number of
points, the hotter the lead. To wrap up this section on “Prospects”, let’s get into
the lead scoring details. How Marketo Uses Lead Scoring To Prioritize Leads
The system is simple: the more points a lead has (on a scale of 1-100), the hotter
the lead. Leads get points added or subtracted based on aspects like how recently
a lead visited and how frequently they visit. Marketo also takes into
consideration other factors, such as keywords, content subject matter and actions
that should increase or diminish scores, i.e., visiting the career page.",
3402,Predictable Revenue,"Marketo also implements “score decay.” This involves decreasing a lead’s score
if they become inactive and get colder and colder and colder. Demographics

If you want to implement this kind of service, don’t worry about getting this
perfect or as detailed as Marketo! Marketo created its own lead scoring process
and points system over time with a lot of experimentation, and they keep
evolving it.",
3403,Predictable Revenue,"The important thing is to get started, look at the results, learn and evolve your
scoring processes until they begin to be useful. Stage 4. “Lead”
Let’s say a prospect scores above 65 points, and now officially becomes a
“lead.” Now what? Once a prospect becomes a lead, it means that they are someone who is truly
interested in Marketo—the company, product or service. At this point, the sales team knows it is definitely worth their time to follow up
on the lead to qualify it and move it into a sales cycle. Sample Lead Conversion Rates
One of the five critical metrics you must track is lead conversion. What
percentage of new leads turn into qualified opportunities? Here’s some example data on Marketo’s conversion rates:
Keeping In Touch With Automated Lead Nurturing Campaigns
Marketo touches buyers in their revenue funnel with four main types of
automated lead nurturing campaigns:
1.",
3404,Predictable Revenue,"New Prospect and Lead Campaigns
When a prospective buyer registers on the site for content, such as for a demo or
a free trial, it kicks off a series of automatic follow up emails. For example, 11 minutes after the content is viewed or downloaded, a targeted
email is automatically sent from the “Lead Owner” to the prospect. The Lead
Owner is the Market Response Rep (or ""rep"") automatically assigned by the
system to own the lead. So automatically every single lead receives an email
from their assigned rep. The rep doesn’t have to remember to check their new
leads every hour. Prospects get FAST follow up from Marketo. Then, the Market Response Rep manually reviews new leads to determine which
ones look like viable prospects, and which ones are junk, spam or other kinds of
wastes of time. After the decision is made that a visitor is a viable prospect, Marketo begins
their 21-day follow up campaign:
21-Day Follow-Up Campaign 
Day 1: Evaluation: Over 65 points?",
3405,Predictable Revenue,"Day 2: Make Phone Call and Send First Email
Day5: ContentOffer Email (invitation to receivemore content)
Day 9: Phone Call
Day 16: Email
Day 21: “Recycle”
If the prospect does not engage actively, they then receive “Stay In Touch
Campaigns.”
2. “Stay in Touch” Campaigns
These campaigns build relationships with leads needing time to “ripen,” who
aren’t yet ready to actively engage with sales. Also known as a “drip campaign,” Marketo sends relevant and useful small
pieces of content to leads over time. This builds trust with leads, helps them
move along in their buying cycle, and reminds leads to contact Marketo first
when the buying cycle becomes active. Nurturing leads isn’t just about making lots of touches—quality is more
important than quantity.",
3406,Predictable Revenue,"Marketo’s Five Tips for Effective Lead Nurturing:
Make it valuable to them, not just you
Make it bite-sized
Match your content to buyer profiles
Match your content to buying stages
Get the timing right
The Marketo Lead Lifecycle
If a prospect exceeds 65 points, they are officially called a “lead” and their status
is changed to “Lead” in Marketo and salesforce.com systems. After this status
change occurs, Marketo starts an automated 21-Day lead lifecycle process. (I know it’s hard to believe, but this diagram came from Marketo, not me.)
This process has multiple tracks and three outcomes. The tracks include:
Fast Track: If a lead fills out a “contact me” form, requests a free trial or
achieves a score of 65+, these leads receive personal follow-up within five
minutes of their activity. The Inside Sales Reps get an automated and instant
alert, telling them to follow-up with this lead immediately either by phone or
email.",
3407,Predictable Revenue,"Other New Prospects: If a prospect reaches a lead scoring threshold of 65
points but doesn’t match the “fast track” behavior, a sales task is set for the sales
rep telling them to interact with this prospect within 24 hours. In those 24 hours, the inside sales rep researches the company and to get a sense
of who they are, their business model and what their marketing needs might be. From there, the sales rep crafts a customized introduction and reaches out to the
prospect, and is better prepared to have a productive conversation when they
connect with the lead by phone or email. Marketo’s Qualification Criteria
Here are Marketo’s five primary criteria:
1. Is there a Compelling Event? 2. Has a Clear Key Pain or Need been Identified? 3. What are the Current Marketing Tools and Processes? 4. What is the Timeframe? 5. What is the Annual Revenue/Size of Company? If a prospect cannot be reached by phone, Marketo sends two emails and one
more call.",
3408,Predictable Revenue,"After the 21-day process there are three possible outcomes. A lead is either:
1. Disqualified: A small fraction of leads that will never be a good fit. 2. Converted to Opportunity: Inside Sales rep hands off lead to a Account
Executive. If this lead is something the Market Response Rep deems
pursuable, they convert it into an opportunity. 3. Recycled: These leads receive ongoing nurturing through email marketing. Sales reps can either go back or take the initiative to reach out to these past
leads, or reps can wait until a lead takes a new action and is flagged as an
active lead. Make It Ridiculously Simple For Sales Reps To Prioritize
Marketo uses Salesforce.com for their sales force automation system. In
addition, Marketo enhances their use of Salesforce.com with their own add-on
product, Sales Insight. This application makes it easy for sales reps using
Salesforce.com to quickly spot and stay focused on their hottest prospects.",
3409,Predictable Revenue,"The dashboard provides a visual of the relevant fit and demographics of the lead
(stars) and the urgency in which the lead needs to be followed up on (flames):
With one view, the sales rep can see all the accounts in their territory with
activity, drill down easily, and then prioritize with whom to spend their time. How To Find Out More

Maximize Your ROI From Tradeshows and Conferences
This section is not meant to replace whatever you’re doing currently with
conferences, it is to give you an additional way to generate leads from them by
using your sales team. Conferences and tradeshows have a bad (ok, terrible) reputation for generating
worthwhile leads - for good reason! Most tradeshow attendees are overwhelmed
with the amount of activity and options at a show.",
3410,Predictable Revenue,"They are bombarded with free
giveaways to get them to give their names up. They sign up for everything for
freebies, regardless of whether they care about the product or not. It's not the fault of tradeshows, the responsibility for lead generation falls to the
attendees, who have to carefully think through the whole lead generation process
(including prior preparation and post-event follow through) on how to generate
real business from the event. You need a process that emphasizes quality of leads over quantity of names. The Event Team
Who is the person responsible for lead generation for this specific event? Who is the ""event sales team""? (Who are the sales reps/people doing the work?)
It's best to have a consistent team of people for the entire process: preparation,
execution at the event, and follow through. How is success going to be measured? This is never about the number of names
logged at an event. Is it the numbers of leads qualified within 2-4 weeks?",
3411,Predictable Revenue,"Is it
qualified pipeline generated after 1-3 months? Closed business over the next 2-6
months? Phase 1: Preparation 
Research as much as you can to shape a list of who and which companies are
attending. Preferably do this at least 3-4 weeks in advance, because you will
need more lead time than you think. Review and really prioritize the list. Go for quality over quantity: it's better to
target fewer, better-fit companies. Have the event sales team prospect in and make initial contact to research the
targets: Do they have a current competitive system? Who are the right decision
makers to target? They might even be able to set up some appointments for the actual event. Prepare a ""Cheat Sheet"" summarizing key points about the target companies at
the event. This information makes it easy to start real conversations with target
prospects (""I understand from John Davis that you use Siebel in your
Institutional division...."").",
3412,Predictable Revenue,"Phase 2: Execution At The Event 
Have members of the sales team staff the event, and give them time to
proactively go out and find the target prospects to approach (cheat sheet in hand
of course). Log every conversation as soon as possible in Salesforce.com, to ensure the
details don't get lost in the shuffle. DISQUALIFY people and avoid indiscriminately scanning every badge that
comes by your booth! If you can actually determine if some people would be a
waste of time as a prospect, it's better to reduce the clutter and keep them out of
the leads list! There is a real cost to keeping lowquality leads on sales reps call
list: 1) it makes it harder to find and focus on the good leads, and 2) sales reps
will be wasting their time calling on lowquality leads. Phase 3: Follow Through 
Have that same Event Sales Team continue to prioritize and work the list of
target prospects, which should now be that much further along the prospecting
cycle because of all the contact made at the event.",

Seven Fatal Sales Mistakes CEOs 
and Sales VPs Make
I never make stupid mistakes. Only very, very clever ones. John Peel
Even Experienced CEOs And Sales VPs Make These Mistakes All
The Time
I’ve consulted with dozens of companies since leaving Salesforce.com. Time and
time again, I’ve seen executives repeat the same, fundamental mistakes as they
work to grow sales. Fatal Mistake 1: Not Taking Responsibility For Understanding Sales and
Lead Generation
Everything begins with the CEO. Even when a CEO hires executives to run lead
generation and sales, the CEO cannot delegate their own understanding of how
lead generation and sales works. The CEO must understand the fundamentals in
order to set effective goals, coach executives, and solve revenue problems.",
3414,Predictable Revenue,"One of my own fatal mistakes as the CEO of LeaseExchange was my delegation
of both the execution and my understanding of lead generation and sales to
others. Not only did I help create arbitrary revenue goals, but I also failed to
really understand the “why” when results didn’t come in as expected... which
means that I didn’t have a clear idea of what needed to change in order to get the
desired results. By having an understanding of how sales and lead generation works, your CEO
can help create realistic plans and visions for the team. The CEO can avoid
arbitrary goals, assumptions, and plans, and thus run a much faster growing,
profitable company. Solution: The CEO takes full responsibility for educating themselves, whether
indirectly through coaching, or directly by getting involved in actual projects.",
3415,Predictable Revenue,"Fatal Mistake 2: Thinking Account Executives Should Prospect (Making
Account Executives Jacks-Of-All Trades) 
Your need your Account Executives (quotacarrying salespeople) to spend most
of their time fulfilling deals or calling on customers, and a minimum of time
prospecting for brand new accounts. Prospecting doesn’t bring in revenue—
closing brings in revenue. The bulk of prospecting into new accounts should be owned by a separate,
dedicated prospecting role. Account Executives should prospect for new clients less than 20% of the time,
and only to a Top 10 Strategic Accounts list, with partners, or to current
customers. The bulk of prospecting into new accounts should be owned by a separate,
dedicated prospecting role. Even for businesses such as consulting that depend
highly on relationships, much of the early work of new account research,
development, and qualification can be handled by cost-effective, focused Sales
Development Reps. Solution: Specialize sales roles.",
3416,Predictable Revenue,"You only need two salespeople to begin
specializing. This is so important that I discuss this in multiple places in the
book. Fatal Mistake 3: Assuming Channels Will Do The Selling For You 
A giant mistake is assuming that even if you can sign up some channel partners,
they will do most of the selling for you. Usually (especially in software and
business service), they won’t. Or can’t. Or they just aren’t very good at it. You have to control your own destiny. You have to build your own sales results
first, and prove your success, before you’ll be able to benefit much from channel
partners. The channels will come AFTER you are successful. Solution: First control your own destiny by building direct sales success before
counting channel chickens. Fatal Mistake 4: Talent Fumbles (Hiring, Training, Incenting) 
Predictable Revenue requires you have repeatable people processes.",
3417,Predictable Revenue,"For
example, “sink or swim training” in which new hires have to fend for themselves
after a few hours or couple of days of training is not repeatable. Executives make all kinds of other mistakes here, including:
Hiring Poorly: Especially in sales leadership (i.e., taking the resume at
face value). Remember, salespeople are talented at SELLING,including
themselves! Insufficient Training: Back to training… new hires should spend time in
any services area that works with live customers before starting their “real”
job, to learn what it’s like to be in the customer’s shoes. See the graphic
below for an example of the “ladder training” approach. Train New Employees in Support / Services
Very important: train salespeople in non-sales roles
Misguided Ramp Time Expectations
Think 1-3 months for inside Account Executives, and up to 6-18 (yes 18!)
months for field or enterprise Account Executives. What is the best way to help them ramp faster?",
3418,Predictable Revenue,"Help them with lead
generation, rather than counting on them to develop 100% of their own
deals. Promoting the Wrong People: Why don’t executives ask “the people” for
their input on who should be promoted? Using Money as the Main (or only) Motivator: And ignoring softer but
more powerful forms of rewards such as respect, appreciation, and fun. Solution: Stop reinventing (and breaking and reinventing…) the wheel on your
own. Get coaching on how to hire, train, and incent, or find local companies to
model. Fatal Mistake 5: Thinking “Product-Out,” Not “Customer-In” 
If your sales or lead generation efforts are struggling, first look to yourself. How
clear is your Ideal Customer Profile? Have you identified their core challenges? Are you marketing to and speaking to those ideal clients, or are you speaking to
too broad an audience, and diluting your voice?",
3419,Predictable Revenue,"Executives hate to do this because they feel like they are shrinking their market
opportunity, but the wisdom says, “Pick a niche, get rich.” Think of a fire hose:
If it’s on a wide spray, it doesn’t go far. But tighten it to a laser-thin stream, and
it will punch through a wall. Think of your messaging the same way. Is it tight
enough to punch through a market’s noise and indifference? It’s the same
amount of water and energy, just with a different focus. Also, companies love to talk about what they do and what they are. “We are the
leading platform in …” No one cares about what you do; they only care what
you can deliver for them. You’re a “platform”? Why is that valuable to
customers? What is the impact or result you can promise customers? Executives need to spend at least 25% of their time with customers, so they stay
connected with “what it’s really like out there.”
Solution: Talk to customers to get clear on what you do for them, rather than
how you do it.",
3420,Predictable Revenue,"Put this into a simple, clear one-page document you can share
with the entire company. Regularly connect with customers by phone or in
person. Fatal Mistake 6: Sloppy Tracking And Measurement 
You can’t have predictability without having repeatable processes. You can’t
make what counts repeatable if you’re not regularly measuring what matters
(and that doesn’t include the number of dials per day your salespeople make). How effectively are you measuring your sales and marketing activities and
results? If you aren’t… why do you keep putting it off? “We’ll do that next week,
quarter, year…”
Unless you understand what works and doesn’t work, you are only guessing
at how to improve. If You Only Track Five Metrics…
Track as many of these as you can in your sales force automation system’s
dashboards:
1. New leads created per month (also, from what source). 2. Conversion rate of leads to opportunities. 3. Number of, and pipeline dollar value of, qualified opportunities created per
month.",
3421,Predictable Revenue,"This is the most important leading indicator of revenue! 4. Conversion rates of opportunities to closed deals. 5. Booked revenues in three categories: New Business, Add-On Business,
Renewal Business. Solution: Start tracking 3-5 key activities or results now. Keep experimenting
with new metrics, old ones, and how you can use them to improve your business. Review them weekly with a core team. Fatal Mistake 7: Command-And-Control Management
Do you find it easier to tell people what to do, rather than coaching them through
it, even though it takes longer and more of your energy and attention? You aren’t alone. It can be challenging to spend a lot of time focused on
supporting your people, and it’s tempting to think “they’re adults, they can figure
it out.”
The danger is that you end up treating employees like resources, rather than
people with lots of potential, energy and ideas they could contribute given the
right circumstances.",
3422,Predictable Revenue,"In Reality…
Most employees have ideas and want to contribute beyond their roles. Most employees want to be inspired and make a difference. Most employees want to be helpful, trusting, and communicative. For most employees, it’s just as exhausting for them as it is for management
to be told what to do all the time. How can you harness the full creativity, inspiration, and output of your
employees? There are plenty of proven practices to help you do this:

CEOFlow: Turn Your Employees Into Mini-CEOs. Bonus Mistake: Under-Investing In Customer Success
CEOs and executives, mostly in the early years of a company, are too focused on
getting new customers, and frequently ignore current and past ones. You get one head to hire… should it be a salesperson, or an account management
person? Almost always the answer is sales.",
3423,Predictable Revenue,"Ignore account management and ongoing customer support at your own peril. We now have a world of “Frictionless Karma.” Bad and good customer
experiences get around instantly rather than taking a lifetime. One bad apple can
spoil a bunch faster than ever. Hold the hands of your first 50 customers; give them lots of love. In 2008, I had a client that was in their second pitch meeting with a bank for a
potentially enormous deal. They had a coach on the inside, and felt the meeting
went great! A few days after this meeting, their coach contacted them and said, “As a friend,
I wanted to let you know that we emailed a bunch of companies we know who
use applications such as yours. You are my own personal favorite company, but
all the responses we received from your clients said your service is terrible. It’s
put you behind the 8-ball in this deal.” That’s not a pleasant message for a VP
Sales to receive. Solution: Hold the hands of your first 50 customers; give them lots of love.",

Google, all share? Customer trust. Customer success. Customer happiness. Customer delight. What are you doing to make your customers satisfied, successful and happy? Sales 1.0 (Promotion) And Sales 2.0 (Attraction)
The Internet has changed everything and has caused major shifts in business and
sales:
In the past Sales worked in a way that was like someone poking you with their
finger, saying, “Going to buy yet?” (Poke) “Going to buy yet?” (Poke) “Going to
buy yet?” (Poke)… until you gave in and just bought, even if it was only to get
that person off your back.",
3425,Predictable Revenue,"Successful selling also used to be mostly about control and manipulation. It was
about getting the deal done and the checkin, without worrying much about what
happened afterward. Companies could sell expensive and crappy products and
get away with it (at least for awhile). Before the Internet, it was much harder to
find out how many customers were unhappy or had been failed. Now that’s all changed, because of the Internet and what I call “Frictionless
Karma.” (If you do something good or bad, it comes back around to you right
away, not in your next lifetime). Great companies know the sale is just the first step in an ongoing process of
making customers successful over a course of years. Sales in the “Attraction” world we live in now isn’t about being passive. You can
still be as aggressive as ever,except the tone has changed.",
3426,Predictable Revenue,"Rather than being
pushy, all about money, and often coming off as fake, it’s about being respectful,
purposeful, and adding real value to prospects, even before they become
customers. Salespeople should be “pleasantly persistent.”
Nine Principles Of Building A Sales Machine
While most of this book is about “what” you should do to create predictable
revenue through a sales machine, “how” you do it is just as important. Here are nine fundamentals about how, day-to-day, you can be much more
effective in the way you build your sales machine:
1) Be PATIENT. Developing a sales engine that predictably generates revenue
can take 4-12 months or more, depending on the state of your company. Even a
single new program (such as a lead generation campaign) in business-to-business
sales can take months and months to be defined, make your first mistakes,
fix‘em, see revenue, and become integrated and habitual. 2) Experiment. With everything. Constantly. A/B test.",
3427,Predictable Revenue,"Try two different phone
scripts or emails with 50 prospects, and measure which one works better. And
apply this idea to everything you do. Test and see what works. 3) Don’t take on one-off projects. (Unless it's an experiment to learn something
for the future). If it's not intended to be repeatable, it's not worth doing. One-off
efforts, even for a quick payoff, are a distraction from focusing your energy on
sustainable efforts. 4) Get out of Excel! Create a rule that if “it” (an opportunity, order, client, etc.)
doesn't exist in your sales force automation system, then it doesn't exist. For
example, salespeople should only be compensated based on the deals and data
that are in your sales system. Reports must be run as much as possible from
within Salesforce.com (or whatever your main metrictracking system is), rather
than in Excel. 5) Sketch out how things work and what your processes are on a flow chart. What is your lead generation or sales process?",
3428,Predictable Revenue,"Can you sketch it out simply, on
paper or a whiteboard? If not, that's a problem. I am not a fan of complex flow
charts—I am easily confused. Even laying out a process in 3-7 high level steps is
useful to everyone involved. Start with defining the desired outcome of a process or team. What does the
process have to look like to lead to that outcome? Is this function being done ad
hoc today? Sketching it out is the first step to bringing some order to the
process... and thus bringing predictability to getting the desired outcome. 6) Focus on results rather than activity. Example: Tracking the number of
qualified opportunities created per month is much more meaningful than
focusing on the number of sales calls made per day. 7) Track fewer, more important metrics. It's easy to go overboard in over-
building reports and dashboards, ending up with “dashboard clutter” in which
too many reports and metrics make it difficult to focus on the most important
ones.",
3429,Predictable Revenue,"Work with your team to prioritize metrics. Think in handfuls, not dozens. Five of the most important metrics in lead generation and sales development:
1. New leads created per month. 2. Number of qualified sales opportunities created per month. And the total dollar amount of new qualified pipeline generated this month
(the best indicator of future revenue). 3. Percentage conversion rate of leads to qualified opportunities. 4. Total bookings or revenue(broken out by “New Business,” “Add-On
Business,” or “Renewal Business.”)
5. Win rates. What percentage of new pipeline resulted in won deals? 8) Pay special attention to “batons” that cross functions. Whenever a process
crosses teams (Marketing handing leads to Sales, or Sales passing new clients to
professional services, etc.), a “baton” is passed. These handoffs are the cause of
80% of the problems and defects in your processes. Redesign how the batons are
passed to ensure they are passed smoothly and aren’t dropped.",
3430,Predictable Revenue,"9) Take baby steps! Consistently try lots of little improvements. If you keep at
them, they'll add up to big changes over time. (Remember the part about
patience?) Companies think that they can make bigger changes than they can,
faster than is possible... and end up biting off more than they can chew, creating
a “two steps forward, two steps back” syndrome. Separate The Four Core Sales Functions
Building a highly productive, modern sales organization requires increasing
specialization,and frankly, it's a big reason Salesforce.com has such an
amazingly productive and successful sales organization. One of the biggest productivity killers is lumping a mix of different
responsibilities (such as raw web lead qualification, cold prospecting, closing,
and account management) into one general ""sales"" role. Inefficiencies Created By “Lumping” 
Lack of Focus: Salespeople juggle too many responsibilities, reducing their
ability to get things done.",
3431,Predictable Revenue,"Salespeople have a reputation for being ADD—
how does adding more responsibilities help that? For example, qualifying
web leads is a much lower value distraction for salespeople than managing
current clients. And managing a large current client base is a distraction
from closing new clients! Harder To Develop Talent: When you only have one or two sales roles,
it's more challenging to bring in raw talent and develop them. There’s no
progressive step-by-step career path. This is unfortunate, because
homegrown talent usually ends up being the best! Unclear Metrics: It's harder to break out and keep track of key metrics
(inbound leads, qualification and conversion rates, customer success
rates...) if all the functions are lumped into single areas. Different roles =
easier to break out different steps in your processes = better metrics.",
3432,Predictable Revenue,"Less Visibility Into Problems: When things aren't working, lumped
responsibilities obscure what's happening and make it more difficult to
isolate and fix issues with accountable follow through. The Four Core Sales Functions (Or “Themes”)
Here are four basic sales functions or themes (I say “themes” because each of
these functions can be sub-divided even further as your organization gets
bigger):
1. “Inbound” Lead Qualification: Commonly called Market Response Reps,
they qualify marketing leads coming inbound through the website or 800-
number. The sources of these leads are marketing programs, search engine
marketing, or organic word-of-mouth. 2. “Outbound” Prospecting/Cold Calling 2.0: Commonly called Sales
Development Reps or new business development reps, this function
prospects into lists of target accounts to develop new sales opportunities
from cold or inactive accounts. This is a team dedicated to proactive
business development.",
3433,Predictable Revenue,"Highly efficient outbound reps and teams do NOT
close deals, but create and qualify new sales opportunities and then pass
them to Account Executives to close. 3. “Account Executives” or “Sales”: These are quotacarrying reps who close
deals. They can be either inside or out in the field. As a best practice, even
when a company has an Account Management/Customer Success function,
Account Executives should stay in touch with new customers they close
past the close until the new customer is deployed and launched. 4. Account Management/Customer Success: Client deployment and
success, ongoing client management, and renewals. In today's world of
“frictionless karma,” someone needs to be dedicated to making customers
successful—and that is NOT the salesperson! If you aren't specializing your people into these kinds of roles, this is the very
first place to begin! You MUST specialize your people to effectively grow
results. When To Specialize?",
3434,Predictable Revenue,"I frequently hear, ""We're too small to specialize yet."" It is always “sooner than
you think,” even if you just have a handful of Account Executives. The second
person you hire, after a salesperson who can close, should be a sales rep who is
dedicated just to generating leads for your first closer. A second rule of thumb is the 80/20 rule. When your reps, as a group, are
spending more than 20% of their time on a secondary function, break out that
function into a new role. For example, if someone whose primary role is to generate outbound leads
begins spending more than 20% of their time qualifying inbound leads, it’s time
to look at specializing and creating a separate role just for responding to inbound
leads. Likewise, if a field salesperson is spending more than 20% of their time
prospecting for new client business (rather than developing business from their
current pipeline and customer base), then look at how you can specialize to
reduce their prospecting burden.",
3435,Predictable Revenue,"Regardless of how many Account Executives (AEs) you have, if you're getting a
couple of hundred inbound leads per month, you should have an inside Market
Response Rep qualifying them for the AEs. If you already have three or four
AEs, don’t make your next hire another AE. Consider hiring an outbound Sales
Development Rep that can spend 100% of their time working to feed the AEs. Online Presentations 
You can find slide presentations on inbound lead management, Cold Calling 2.0,
and more on www.PredictableRevenue.com. If You Sell To Sales Executives... If you sell to sales executives, change your fiscal year to January 31 or February
28. Why make life unnecessarily harder on yourself by trying to close deals with
the very people that are trying to close their own deals at the same time? Salesforce.com, a company that knows something about selling to sales
executives, ends their fiscal year January 31st.",
3436,Predictable Revenue,"Don’t expect as many email or phone responses from sales executives as you
approach the end of the month or quarter. Be respectful and wait to call them a
couple of days after the period ends. Likewise, most sales executives are on smart phones, so with new prospects,
send short emails that are easy to read and respond to, and that don’t require a lot
of thinking and processing. If you don't sell to sales executives and this example doesn't apply to you, what
can you do to make buying easier? What kinds of patterns or challenges or
seasonalities do they live with that you can work around, rather than fight
against? A Totally Different Vision For Structuring Sales Teams
I have a vision for technology companies, one that is already working in some
other kinds of services and manufacturing companies.",
3437,Predictable Revenue,"The management practices of most business-to-business technology and business
services industries are in many ways like the manufacturing practices of the
giants of old, like General Motors, that were surpassed by the lean giants of late,
like Toyota. I want to see the management and sales models of more companies evolve
towards a collection of “businesses inside a bigger business.” Rather than being
divided into teams based purely on function (Sales, Marketing Services),
employees are grouped into minibusiness units that include a variety of
functional roles in each team. For example… What if, instead of having massive and distinct teams of people
just doing sales, or only doing support, or only marketing, you remixed those
employees into minibusiness units similar to a retail chain that is composed of
lots of minibusinesses (retail stores)? Say you’re a software company.",
3438,Predictable Revenue,"What if you created a “pod-team” minibusiness
structure with its own territory that included (just as an example) one marketing
person, two inside salespeople, two outside salespeople, an account manager,
two support people, and a technical expert/ sales engineer? What if each person in that minibusiness could learn about customer needs and
experiences from each other? Imagine your sales guy, after he’s been through
basic sales training with other salespeople, is sitting next to a marketing person
and a support person…
Wouldn’t the salesperson know how to sell more effectively by learning from the
marketing and support persons how to speak in the customers’ language, avoid
problem customers, set expectations, get more referrals and win more deals? Wouldn’t the marketing person learn how to market more effectively by hearing
the salesperson sell, and by learning from the support person how customers
actually use the product?",
3439,Predictable Revenue,"Wouldn’t the support person head off more issues early before they fester,
because they’ve been able to observe the lifecycle of the customer from the point
they entered the sales cycle? What if you measured and compensated the minibusinesses on metrics that
completely align with your company’s key metrics, such as Revenue,
Profitability, and ROI of their minibusiness? What if one of the team was a miniCEO, who ran the team like a general
manager of a retail store or division and managed the financial profit and loss
statement of his minibusiness: managing hiring, firing, coaching, customer
satisfaction and sales? Can you imagine the kind of talented people you could develop this way, people
who could truly be miniCEOs in your business and help take it to the next level
without needing you to hold their hands? I know someone out there must be doing something like this in technology or
other high-value services businesses.",

Cultivating Your Talent
The quality of your people means everything to you and your team’s success. As an old Chinese Proverb says:
If you want one year of prosperity, grow grain. If you want ten years of prosperity, grow trees. If you want one hundred years of prosperity, grow people. Happy Employees Develop Happy Customers
Remember the “Happy Customers Required For Extraordinary Growth” sketch? Well, it begins with developing a great culture in your company first. What are you doing to help your employees actually enjoy their work? The
example you set as a CEO or leader will ripple out (positively or negatively)
through the company and culture…
""Where Do I Hire Great Salespeople?""
I'm asked this all the time. Of course it's always hard to find great people,
whether in sales or any other function. The best long-term source of salespeople
is to grow and develop your own.",
3441,Predictable Revenue,"Combine one part veteran with three parts young, smart and adaptable... and mix
in a system that keeps challenging people to learn new things, to stretch, step by
step. The best salespeople are the ones that have grown up in your company, and
know it, your products, your customers, inside and out. Create A Farm Team System
Think about how you can create a career path for people, to continually develop
and grow them. Each group can act as a feeder team to the next. Here's a startup/
small sales team example:
Market Response Rep (responds to website leads)
Sales Development Rep (develops new opportunities at cold accounts)
Account Executive/Sales Executive (closes deals)
You can have a much more specific system with more levels. In the following
example, with a larger organization and more roles, each role helps prepare the
person to succeed in the next step:
1. Marketing intern or Sales Operations contractor
2. Inside Sales Development, Qualify Inbound Leads
3.",
3442,Predictable Revenue,"Inside Sales Development, Outbound Prospecting
4. Inside Sales Closing, Small/Medium Businesses
5. Inside Sales Closing, Small Field Deals
6. Field Sales Closing, Mid-Market Accounts
7. Field Sales Closing, Enterprise Accounts
And this doesn't even include account management, sales engineers, customer
support, and other customer-related teams that always benefit from moving
people in and around them. The more kinds of different experiences your people are exposed to and develop
an expertise in, the better equipped they are to become killer problem-solvers for
customers! And that's a great thing in ANY role in the company, customer-facing
or not. Timing
Depending on the role, you'll want to move people up the ladder (or rotate into
another group) anywhere from 6-8 months on the very fast side, early in the first
stages of the system, to 1-3 years in the other stages.",
3443,Predictable Revenue,"Any short-term transaction
cost/effort in moving someone into a new role is really outweighed by the
benefits of getting a more well-rounded, developed employee who has another
learning curve to keep them energized, and a broader understanding of what
customers need. The Very Best Salespeople... Hire and promote carefully! The best salespeople are more like consultants or
business people who can sell than salespeople. In addition, they are the ones
who:
Listen much more than they talk. Are problem-solvers. Understand their customers’ industry/business/needs (key to both building
trust with customers as well as understanding how to help solve their
problems). Believe in their product and company. Demonstrate unquestionable integrity. Can get things done in their own company (via internal networks). Are you hiring these kinds of people? Have you written out an “Ideal Employee”
profile for your interviewers to help them know who to hire, and how to
interview?",
3444,Predictable Revenue,"How are you training and developing the people you’ve already hired? If you
don’t have some kind of training or development program in place, it’s probably
not happening as much as it should. Even having a one-hour team training
session once a week (Tuesday or Wednesday afternoons) can make a big
difference in your team’s sales skills. Should You Consider Commission-Only Salespeople? For 95% of the companies I talk with, I am not a fan of commission-only
salespeople. Each executive understands what's best for their unique market and
business, but it's hard to imagine a situation in which I would recommend that
you hire commission-only salespeople. The exception is in an industry in which commission-only is a well-known and
practiced standard, such as financial services.",
3445,Predictable Revenue,"Your environment determines whether your people succeed or not, and
“commission-only” doesn't demonstrate commitment by the sales leadership or
the company that they're really there and incented to help their salespeople
succeed. Pros:
Reduced risk in hiring (there are still time and opportunity costs)
Salespeople are highly incented to close business
Cons:
If your sales cycles are more than a month or two long, commission-only
salespeople will begin starving before they can realistically close enough
business. They are more likely to fall out before you can see whether or not
they will really work out. The company will attract more inexperienced salespeople that can't get
better jobs. Commission-only increases the motivation to ""do wrong"" to close a sale. You do not want desperate salespeople representing your company. They
will increase your liability, decrease your customer success and satisfaction,
and wreck your culture and morale.",
3446,Predictable Revenue,"Erratic compensation and lack of reliable income means your salespeople
have more financial problems, ironically distracting them from work goals. If you have a “churn and burn” culture that sells commoditized product, perhaps
commission-only sales is a way to go. If you want to build a solution-selling, high-value sales force, commit the team
and company to invest in their success just as much as you expect them to invest
in the company! Internal Training Builds A Better Sales Force
Ongoing training can be the cheapest and easiest (yes, easiest) way to improve
your team's performance. It takes commitment and focus, but is always a great
investment of your time. The Best and Cheapest Investment In Your People…
...is consistent, regular training and coaching (especially new hires). I see again
and again what a difference regular training makes in improving sales skills and
results, reducing ramp time and increasing “promotability” (yeah, I just made
that word up, but what a concept!).",
3447,Predictable Revenue,"Simple monitored practice exercises, with feedback, can make a dramatic,
noticeable difference in performance, whether in public speaking, objection
handling, phone skills, demos or personal/career development. What Works 
A program with an ongoing, regular format. Includes exercises/role-playing and useful feedback. Is designed effectively, to make it worth your reps' time. Follow through on everything: maintain the schedule, check progress, keep
it fresh and don't let things slip. Finally, the most important thing to making this work is commitment from the
CEO or VP Sales to follow through and stick to it. You will have kinks to work
out over weeks, months or quarters. Internal training will only get the attention
and time it deserves if the management team believes in it, and is willing to
invest in it.",
3448,Predictable Revenue,"The Importance Of Follow-through
""One hit wonder"" programs without follow-through actually detract from
performance: 1) any progress isn't lasting, 2) you've wasted the time and
resources invested in the one hit wonder, and 3) your team will see that you or
the organization aren’t really committed to training... so why bother? For an ongoing lasting benefit to your productivity, you MUST follow through
on each aspect of the program and demonstrate management's commitment to it. If you aren't committed, your sales reps won't be committed. Example: A New Hire Program and Sales Boot Camp
Does your company have any formal initial training for new salespeople and
hires? For example, a ""Sales Boot Camp"" ending with certification exercises in
how reps conduct initial sales presentations and demos? New hires should be initially ranked by performance for sales executives.",
3449,Predictable Revenue,"Over
time, salespeople should annually re-certify on product knowledge and
competition, two examples of ever-changing areas. Example: Embedding Training Into Career Paths
Use internal promotion paths for additional opportunities to train people. When a
salesperson wants a promotion, put them through a mock sales situation
depending on their level of experience. For example, the most junior people can
go through a ""first call customer pitch"" presentation (the first in-person
presentation to a prospect company) as their promotion interview. This both gives the interviewing sales executives a chance to assess potential,
and incents salespeople to invest in developing the skills they need to get to the
next sales level (public speaking, objection handling, etc.). The Best Kind Of Sales Training
Nothing beats role-playing as a form of training.",
3450,Predictable Revenue,"Even compared to live “on the
phones” training, my favorite thing about role playing is that you can stop and
redo a whole or part of a session time and time again, until someone gets it. You can use role-playing to train people on calls, demos or live presentations. How To Do It
First, include role-playing in your new hire training, and in your regular team
trainings. Let’s use a role-playing call as an example of how to do it. A scenario is created and described to the group. Let’s say an SDR is going
to call on the VP Marketing at a division of General Electric. Or perhaps
they are conducting a discovery call with two executives from that division. The trainee is selected. One or more people are selected to pretend to be the prospect company. (You can have different people in different roles on a single call or demo:
CEO, VP Sales, etc). Send off the person to be trained, back to their cube or another room. Everyone else goes into a conference room.",
3451,Predictable Revenue,"This includes the others on the
sales team, so they can listen in. The trainee dials into the conference room… and off you go! The training lead should challenge the trainee, but not make it so hard that they
get frustrated and don’t learn anything. You’ll find that it is easier than you think to get into the role, especially if you
have any good actors. (By the way, don’t fail to notice the “creative types”!) 
A Self-Managing Weekly “SalesforceU” Training Meeting
Some functions can be designed to be self-managing without a designated leader. My team had a “Salesforce University” meeting every Wednesday afternoon for
ongoing education. We modeled it after the Toastmasters public-speaking
organization format, and customized it for our specific business needs. It was self-organizing. Each week someone would volunteer (or would be
volunteered, if they were shy and needed a kick in the pants) to manage the next
week’s agenda and meeting.",
3452,Predictable Revenue,"The agenda often included a mix of topics in 10-15 minute chunks, such as:
Product or sales training. General business topics (like understanding financial statements or how to
manage people). Public speaking: Sales reps would present to the whole team for practice
and feedback
“Dealer’s Choice” anything the agenda owner wanted to include just for fun
The Meeting Leader for that week didn’t have to create the content for the next
meeting; they were just responsible for finding speakers, organizing them, and
running the meeting. This was their own opportunity to begin developing
miniCEO skills at a very basic level. Here is a specific example of a Salesforce University (SalesforceU) agenda:
1. Meeting Leader Opening (1min): Got the meeting started on time. Introduced first speaker. Kept the meeting on track and on time. 2.",
3453,Predictable Revenue,"Sales Skills 1 (10-20min): We usually used this block for public
speaking/presentation practice, from simple firsttime presentations up to a
full sales role-play exercise, including a business scenario, pitch, objection
handling, and competition. Before moving on, the Meeting Leader asked
the team to share immediate feedback for the speaker. 3. Quick Questions (10-15min): A team member prepared four to five
questions that prospects commonly asked, and calls on people to answer
them and get their feet put to the fire! The questions required short 1-2
minute answers. After each answer, other teammates quickly shared their
feedback and suggestions of better answers. 4. Sales Skills 2 (10-20min): A second bite-sized session to practice public
speaking, role-play phone calls, demos, etc. 5. New Best Practice (10min): The topic owner shared one of their own best
practices or found a coworker’s worth sharing. 6.",
3454,Predictable Revenue,"Industry/Vertical Learning (15min): Each week we selected a vertical for
someone to research. They updated the team with information that helps
prospect and sell more effectively: terminology, business model fit (or lack
thereof), targeted discovery questions, current reference customers, etc. The
content owner of this section ended up being the team expert in that area. 7. Meeting Leader Closing (5min): Closed the meeting by:
Asked for feedback on the SalesforceU format—should it change for next
week? Chose a SalesforceU Lead for the next session. Content owners for the next week were determined. The new SalesforceU Lead wrote down the updated roles and was responsible
for making following week’s meeting successful. I had to consciously pull my energy back and resist “managing.”
Meetings averaged about an hour to an hour-and-a-half, and the meeting leader
was responsible for keeping it on time (another great miniCEO skills practice).",
3455,Predictable Revenue,"Once in awhile we organized special sessions, such as a full-team demo practice
exercise. The manager’s only participation was, along with everyone else in the room, to
share feedback with speakers, and coach the Meeting Leader if necessary. I had
to consciously pull my energy back and resist “managing.” The more I put my
energy and presence into the meeting, the less space there was for people to
share their own energy and ideas. The SalesforceU Meeting Leader may not have run a meeting before. It was their
responsibility to ask for help and advice about how to run a successful session. There was no shortage of expertise all around them, and there was no excuse for
not tapping into it. With the meeting-to-meeting handoff of roles, and a feedback mechanism built
in, the meeting became a self-perpetuating engine. 10
Leadership and Management
Nothing so conclusively proves a man's ability to lead others as what he does
from day to day to lead himself. ~Thomas J.",
3456,Predictable Revenue,"Watson
6 Responsibilities Of A Manager
A no-nonsense management model:
1. Choose people carefully
2. Set expectations and vision
3. Remove obstacles
4. Inspire your people
5. Work for your people
6. Improve it next time
1. Choose People Carefully
It often makes sense to hire for talent and adaptability than for experience. Over
time, the best employees are ones that can adapt to changing circumstances and
roles. A fast-learning, hungry hire can make up for a reasonable lack of
experience in 6-12 months, and then surpass more experienced peers. My best performing salesperson in 2004 had never held a sales role before he
joined our team. If you have a great candidate but are concerned about their
experience, consider creating a ""starter"" role in which to test them for 6 months. 2. Set Expectations And Vision
Don't define the role in terms of activities; rather, define it in results as much as
possible.",
3457,Predictable Revenue,"If you lay out a too-inflexible process to achieve results, you 1) prevent
individuals from being creative in improving the process, and 2) risk that the
process won't connect with some individuals, and they'll underperform. Tell them where on the map they need to get to, give them advice and guidance,
but then let them find their way. 3. Remove Obstacles
Managers also have to act like a professional sports commission that sets and
enforces rules, defines the playing field, the referee system, etc., and then stands
to let the teams play. If the playing field, rules or refereeing isn't clear and fair,
games grind to a halt with uncertainty, arguments and confusion. Simplicity, clarity = productivity
Uncertainty, ambiguity = waste
Likewise in sales, if territories, holdouts and rules of engagement, comp plans
and sales processes are undecided or confusing, it creates pure ""friction"": wasted
time and effort with zero benefit.",
3458,Predictable Revenue,"To create a frictionless environment for your salespeople, set up and update (on
time) clear territories, comp plans and holdout/transition rules. 4. Inspire Your People 
Inspiring is not cheerleading, it’s understanding what helps your team and its
individuals find their own reasons (not your reasons) to excel and to achieve
their full potential (not your potential). Compensation structure is part of it, but just as important are regular
complements on good work, in both private and public. Opportunities for career
advancement, the opportunity to learn or achieve particular goals, and many
other factors can affect motivation (or lack thereof). ""Pit bull"" management personalities can unfortunately be glorified in media (as
in Glengarry Glen Ross) and in some aggressive organizations. These managers
are terrible for long-term individual and company productivity. The good people
who have options will just leave, leaving your company with all the people who
can't get other jobs.",
3459,Predictable Revenue,"Don't be a pushover either. Balance positive encouragement with discipline. 5. Work For Your People 
How satisfied would you be in your job if there was no opportunity to learn,
grow or be promoted? Does your own manager take the time to help develop
you? Your people want the same things. Take time to proactively understand their
individual life/career goals, then work to help them achieve those goals. Help
each person find their right fit and path in the company rather than automatically
getting them to the next rung on the promotion ladder. Treat any mistakes as
learning and coaching opportunities. Rather than thinking that they work for you, cultivate a mindset that you work
for your people. The more you work for their success, the more they’ll work for
the team’s success and yours. 6. Improve It Next Time
What would you do differently next time with any of the above five steps? Periodically go back over the above five steps. Improve and change as your
company grows.",
3460,Predictable Revenue,"What works today can be improved tomorrow. Retaining Star Employees
Your company's long-term success will always depend on maintaining and
developing great people. Are you at risk of losing any star employees? Would
you even know if you were at risk, or will you find out when they tell you of a
new offer they just accepted? There's a great way to measure the satisfaction of your key employees. Buckingham and Coffman's book, First, Break All The Rules: What The World's
Greatest Managers Do Differently, outlines 12 key measures for employees:
1. Do I know what is expected of me at work? 2. Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right? 3. At work, do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day? 4. In the last seven days, have I received recognition or praise for good work? 5. Does my supervisor, or someone at work, seem to care about me as a
person? 6. Is there someone at work who encourages my development? 7. At work, do my opinions seem to count? 8.",
3461,Predictable Revenue,"Does the mission/purpose of my company make me feel like my work is
important? 9. Are my coworkers committed to doing quality work? 10. Do I have a best friend at work? 11. In the last six months, have I talked with someone about my progress? 12. At work, have I had opportunities to learn and grow? Managers: Focus First On The Initial Six Questions

Alignment 
Through
Salesforce.com’s V2MOM Planning Process
One of Marc Benioff ’s key business practices that helped Salesforce.com grow
to more than $1 billion in revenue in less than 10 years was the V2MOM
planning process. Marc Benioff came up with a plan to set the company’s vision and align all of its
people and teams in the execution of the vision.",
3462,Predictable Revenue,"V2MOM stands for Vision,
Values, Methods, Obstacles, and Metrics. The V2MOM process helped the company (and the teams and people in it) lay
out a vision, prioritize the most effective methods to achieve that vision,
anticipate problems ahead of time, and understand how they would measure
success. This was done at every level in the company: by the company as a
whole, by teams, and also by each individual (i.e., I created a personal Aaron
Ross V2MOM). This creates alignment up and down the organization, from the CEO down to
individual salespeople and support organizations. We took the V2MOM process
very seriously. The executive team alone spent 80-100 hours just in creating it at
the CEO level. When I led my sales team, it took about 10-15 hours as a group
to create the team version and then about 2-4 hours per individual for their
personal versions. It was well worth the investment.",
3463,Predictable Revenue,"Below are examples of the five principles of the V2MOM process at each level,
so that you can learn from this to try it on your own:
1. VISION: What’s The Big Picture? What is your vision for the next 12 months? Corporate: “Double our enthusiastic and wildly successful global customer
and partner community through flawless execution of our proven model.”
Team (my sales team):“Make a difference in the success of our team and
company by being the best in the world at generating new business, through
constant innovation and the sharing of our expertise.”
Individual (from my personal V2MOM):“Manageteam members as a leader
who will be remembered 10 years from now as their best ever.”
2. VALUES: Top General Priorities? What are the top three business values most important to keep in mind while
working toward that vision?",
3464,Predictable Revenue,"Corporate: “Customer Trust”, this was a top value during a year that
Salesforce.com had recurring uptime and technology problems that were
damaging trust with customers and partners, “Flawless Execution and
Customer Success.”
Team: “Persistency. Efficiency. Success.” Each can have multiple meanings. “Success” meant success of each individual on my team, of the sales team,
of our prospects and customers, and anyone we came in contact with inside
and outside of the company. Individual: “Hands-on Leadership. Watertight Execution. Practical
Innovation.”
3. METHODS: How Will It Happen? What are the actual things you will do to hit your goals? What will you create? Rather than vague generalities, be as specific and clear as you can. Corporate: “Increase adoption through sales, service, and partner
effectiveness by…” including more detailed specifics about programs and
practices to clarify what this actually means.",
3465,Predictable Revenue,"Team: “Don’t take‘NO’ until you get to the VP Sales.” While it might seem
obvious to have this as a sales tactic, I found that new salespeople gave up
too easily when they received “no” from someone like the VP Marketing. It
was so important to reinforce this practice of never giving up at an ideal
prospect that we made it a V2MOM Method. Individual: “Lead from the trenches.” I never asked people to do something
I wouldn’t do. I kept as close to them as possible and involved them in my
own world as much as I could. 2nd personal example: “A successful team is made up of successful
individuals…” which meant I cultivated the mindset that I worked for them,
rather than that they worked for me. By focusing on making every
individual successful, the team succeeded. 4. OBSTACLES: What Is Or Could Be In The Way? Identify landmines ahead of time to plan for and avoid.",
3466,Predictable Revenue,"Corporate: “IT and corporate fear of having data outside the firewall.”
Team: “It’s‘easier’ to work harder than to work smarter.” Putting in longer
and longer hours is a crutch for people who don’t know how to redesign
their work or process to make it easier to get results. In our culture, it’s easy
to backslide into two habits to solve problems: “throw hours at it” and
“throw money at it.”
Individual: “Size of team heading to 17 direct reports.” The number of my
direct reports was a challenge. When a team is growing, people need more
attention and coaching. I found it very difficult to give each person the
individual coaching and attention they needed once the team grew past 10
people. It was this kind of growth that kept me pushing the boundaries of
creating self-managing systems, to find ways for peers to help and coach
each other. 5. METRICS: How Will You Measure Success? Corporate: Revenue, adoption rates, etc. Team: We never measured daily dials or calls.",
3467,Predictable Revenue,"Our method focused more on
a series of results-based metrics such as Conversations Per Day, Qualified
Opportunities Per Month, New Pipeline Per Month, and Total Closed
Bookings. Individual: I had some key life-and Salesforce.com-related career goals
here, such as “Make $170,000+ per year starting next year”; “Gain Asia and
EMEA operating experience”; and “Complete Hawaii Half-Ironman in June
2005.”
Three Ways To Inspire And Improve The Sales Organization
1. Include Salespeople In The Planning Of New Programs
Start by asking the sales organization about how they want to have their voices
included in the business. What would they change? What would they do if they
managed it? Just as getting customer insight is important early in the product design process,
you can save yourself a lot of frustration and get a much better “sales product”
by including salespeople early in the design process. You don’t have to mandate feedback or ideas, just ask for volunteers.",
3468,Predictable Revenue,"People
don’t necessarily want to contribute, but they do want the choice of being able to
contribute. There will be a reasonable number of people who want to actively help, either by
offering ideas or in actually driving the process, so try letting them. 2. Beta Test New Sales Programs
Draft your program or rule, and then submit it to groups for feedback. Beta test
it. Catch bugs or design issues early, before it’s released to everyone. Yes, this means you’ll need to plan next year’s territories and comp plans
BEFORE the end of this year (shocking, I know!)
3. Survey Satisfaction
How satisfied are your salespeople with the support they get and their
environment? What tools or parts of the environment are frustrating? You can do this by walking the halls, posing the question in sales meetings, or
using a simple service like www.surveymonkey.com.",
3469,Predictable Revenue,"It takes some work and creative thinking, but involving the sales force in the
design of its own products will raise morale and engagement and improve their
sales tools, both of which lead to more results. Try this out with your sales organization, and then move to practicing it across
the company. Why Do Salespeople Resist Following Directions? Executives from every company bemoan how their salespeople (and all other
kinds of employees) don’t follow processes, programs or directions. If all the
programs, tools, and rules that you’ve created actually helped salespeople sell
more, and had been communicated effectively, wouldn’t salespeople be adopting
more of them? So why don’t they? I’m going to use sales as the specific function and example for how to help
employees get things done in a way that you see is beneficial to the company,
such as following a sales process, but you can apply the principles anywhere in
your organization.",
3470,Predictable Revenue,"The conventional sales management model is about telling people what to do
and having them obey. Every sales executive and manager gets frustrated with
salespeople not doing as they’re told: “They don’t use the sales force automation
system... They don’t make enough calls... They don’t sell to value... They don’t
understand their compensation plan… Our training session attendance is poor... They don’t forecast...”. One option is to bang your head against the wall as much as you can, trying to
force or coerce salespeople into doing things. However, it’s a very painful and
frustrating way to try to drive behavior, for both sides. And it doesn’t even work very well anymore “with these uppity, demanding
employees we have now who don’t want to be ordered what to do and how to do
it!”
Why:
1. People hate to be told what to do; thus coercion naturally creates
resistance. How do you feel when someone tells you to do something?",
3471,Predictable Revenue,"(Rather than
explaining why something’s important and then asking for your teamwork or
help.) Do you want to comply, or do you purposely want to not do it just to show
them they can’t tell you what to do? 2. It’s a quick fix, not a solution. Coercion is an attempt to find a shortcut around better user design. Great design
is hard and takes time, and in our “urgency addicted” culture, we tend to think,
“How can we get this done now? How can we roll this out now?” (This is
especially in sales, where there’s always pressure for immediate results!)
3. You’re going to lose the complexity battle. All the sales programs, tools, plans, and rules only seem to get more complicated
and grow over time. At some point, the complexity crosses an inflection point
from “useful” to “hairball.”
It’s challenging balancing the values of more features and usability. The best way to fight this battle is to improve how you choose and launch your
internal processes, tools and programs. Involve your people!",
3472,Predictable Revenue,"For example, even
include salespeople in the process of updating a comp plan. This doesn’t work unless you take listening seriously. If you give lip service to
listening and adopting feedback, nothing will change. Worse, should you ask for
input and not institute any of it, you risk leaving your staff feeling undervalued
which leads to morale issues, lowered productivity, and stressed staff. Source: the “Creating Passionate Users” blog
Your people aren’t lazy, stubborn, or process-averse. They are just averse to
complicated processes that don’t make sense to them, weren’t explained properly,
or don’t help them. In fact, they love intuitive processes and tools that help them
sell more. So, this thing you want your salespeople to do, is it something that will truly
help them, or is it more of an administration function for your own benefit? The
latter is okay, but you need to explain why it is important to the salespeople
before they will buy in.",
3473,Predictable Revenue,"Use the word “because” a lot in your communications. Salespeople are all very busy, with all kinds of demands competing for their
attention, so they instinctively prioritize their time. Unless the tool or idea given to them is intuitive, they’ll dismiss spending the
mental time and energy to figure it out, and aren’t most of us the same way? Engage Their Help To Better Serve Your People
First, start learning how to earn, rather than demand, their attention. Instead of
trying to push mandates or arbitrary programs onto salespeople, try a different
approach: consider how you market to customers. You earn the business and attention of customers. What if you tried thinking of
salespeople as customers or users, and your tools, sales environment, and
programs are the “products”? Can you force your customers to do things? No. You have to design a product or
service that they appreciate and that improves their business. In doing so, you
earn the business and attention of your customers.",
3474,Predictable Revenue,"The same can be done for
your internal “customer”—your salespeople. Consider what could happen if you made your sales organization “salesperson-
centric”? By the way, if you’re having customer and marketing problems, part of it could
be a reflection of what’s not working with your internal marketing and servicing
of your own employees. Consider what could happen if you made your sales organization “salesperson-
centric”? Since they’re the ones actually working with customers and selling
stuff, that can only be a good thing. If you were to focus (with your employees as you do your customers) on
usability and ROI, in this case, “return on salesperson’s time”, how would you
redesign your sales environment, organization, and tools? Can you make whatever you want salespeople to spend time on as valuable to
them as calling a prospect or customer?",
3475,Predictable Revenue,"Involve the sales teams in the identification, selection and design of initiatives,
so they can feel like owners, get their input in early and become champions once
it’s ready to roll-out. How To Design Self-Managing Teams And Processes
Ready to start shifting your teams toward more self-management? Let’s assume you have gone through at least the “Vision” portion of V2MOM or
your own planning process, and your team has created a vision that includes a
full or partial method of turning your employees into miniCEOs with more self-
managing systems. The employees buy in because they want more control over their work, and they
desire to become self-managing—even to the level of the janitor picking his own
hours to come in and clean. I recommend doing the following process with a single team first—such as a
sales team—to find out what works for your culture, before moving on to other
teams.",
3476,Predictable Revenue,"Patiently and persistently keep at the goal of shifting the culture and team
toward the common vision. Be prepared for it to take longer than you think,
because you are dealing with changing habits—and habits don’t like to change. Start by asking these two questions:
1. How would the team operate if the manager disappeared tomorrow? 2. What would have to happen for the team not to just continue operating at its
current level, but actually to improve its results? For example, here are some common key responsibilities of a VP Sales:
1. Goal setting and achievement
2. Personal involvement in big deals
3. Culture
4. Compensation—designing, calculating, reporting
5. Talent—structuring roles, hiring, firing
6. Coaching
7. Analysis and reporting
8. Budgeting / expenditures
9. Process design and improvement
Take your list, starting at the top, and brainstorm your way down, point by point.",
3477,Predictable Revenue,"For example, how would “Goal Setting and Achievement” work if the VP Sales
disappeared tomorrow and wasn’t replaced? If you get stuck or feel like you want to cheat and pretend only one person can
be the owner of that point, remember what Charles de Gaulle said: “The
graveyards are full of indispensable men.”
As you finish going through the list, a vision will shape as to how the team can
self-manage itself. Don’t try to implement every point on your list at once. Select
a few (two or three) of the points that are the most important and easiest to
implement, before moving on to the other points. Build some momentum with
initial successes. What’s In It For The VP Sales (Or Any Manager)? If you start giving away all the responsibilities and power of a manager, won’t
they feel threatened that you won’t need them? No!",
3478,Predictable Revenue,"The more a sales team can manage itself, the more the VP Sales can focus on
developing the “important, not urgent” aspects of the team, such as talent,
culture and vision, rather than fighting fires or spending time on daily,
“unimportant but urgent” tasks. Even better, by freeing up their own time and energy, the VP Sales (and other
executives) can take on more of your (the CEO’s) responsibilities, and this
allows you freedom and energy for even bigger things yourself! See how this works? You get what you give. Create more freedom and upside for
your people, and you’ll get it in turn. When Distributing Responsibilities, Begin With Elimination
As you work through your list of responsibilities and tasks, it’s a perfect
opportunity to use the 80/20 rule to clear out non-essential tasks.",
3479,Predictable Revenue,"Rather than
distributing 100% of the work of the manager, divide the work into two parts: 1)
the 20% that is the most important to keep within the team or company, and 2)
the 80% that can be eliminated, automated, or outsourced. You can do this with two columns on a whiteboard: “Important 20%” and “Other
80%.” In the 80% column, how can you first eliminate as much as possible? Work through the responsibilities this way:
1. What can you Eliminate? 2. What can be Automated? 3. What can you Outsource? 4. Finally, Delegate or Distribute what is left. For functions that can’t be eliminated, how can you use the core CEOFlow
values of Transparency and Trust to eliminate 80% of the reporting, monitoring,
checking and auditing?",
3480,Predictable Revenue,"(You can see more examples in my book CEOFlow:
How to Turn Your Employees Into Mini-CEO's in the chapter on “The Power Of
Transparency.”)
For example, rather than having a process to pre-approve expenditures, try
eliminating the approval process entirely, and transparently publish everyone’s
expense reports or team expenditures against budgets. In that kind of expenditures system, create a process in which individuals must
seek advice from others before spending money. It could be a process in which a
peer, not a manager, must approve the expenditure. Peer review and transparency
are a much more powerful and productive combination than administrative rules
and regulations. Then after eliminating and reducing as much as possible, go through and map
out what you can automate or outsource, in ways that will both free your time
and improve results. After you’ve created plans for eliminating, automating, and outsourcing as much
as possible, move on to delegating.",
3481,Predictable Revenue,"Distributing Management Through Sub-Teams And Team Leads
I will use a couple of terms here: (1) “Team Lead” and (2) “[Specific Function]”
Lead, like “Training Program Lead.”
When a group grows past 8-10 people, it is easy to begin losing that intimate,
small team feel. People start feeling lost in a crowd—or worse, that they can
hide. When my sales team grew to 15 direct reports, well past my ability to give each
person the amount of attention they deserved, I divided the team into three sub-
teams of 5 people. Each sub-team then selected their own “team lead,” like a squad leader, who
would best support them in their personal sales success. These team leads were not managers but salespeople with extra responsibilities,
there to ensure their sub-team functioned smoothly. They were my miniCEOs
that took over my daily and (to me) lower-value tasks like compensation reports
(which were high-value to them, because they were learning and developing).",
3482,Predictable Revenue,"While I often didn’t have people on my team for more than 8 months (because
we were growing so fast, and I kept promoting people), I would recommend you
make team lead roles rotating positions, say every three-to-six months, so
different people can develop and practice leadership skills. Creating Sub-Teams Without Single Team Leads
Another way to create self-managing teams—rather than having any sort of team
leads at all—is to spread responsibilities across the team by creating functional
leads: “Goals Setting Lead,” “New Hires Lead,” “Education Lead,” “Coaching
System Lead,” “Recruiting Lead,” etc. You can rotate these roles every few
months. Part of the responsibilities of an outgoing Lead is always to train the
incoming Lead. A functional lead doesn’t have to be the one doing all the work. They are only
responsible for it getting done, whether or not they do it. A “Research Lead” could be responsible for managing an outsourced firm that is
doing the actual research.",
3483,Predictable Revenue,"A “Sales Hiring Lead” could be responsible for
organizing the hiring process and making sure the interviews get done, without
actually doing any interviews themselves. A Team Leads Example
When you have a function that does need internal ownership by someone (like
coaching of new hires), select a single person to be responsible for it, no
committees. Make them a miniCEO of that function. Whether or not that person does the actual work isn’t important. What is
important is they are responsible for it getting done—and better than before. For example, before I created my team leads and sub-teams system, I spent at
least half of my time coaching and training new hires. As the team grew, I wasn’t
able to give them and the veteran sales reps the time and attention they all
deserved. When we moved to a team leads and sub-teams system, my sales team
leads assumed 80%+ of the first few weeks of training and coaching for any new
hire that entered their own sub-team.",
3484,Predictable Revenue,"Each team lead ensured that the new hire
ramped up on time over the first six weeks. I was free to coach the veterans on
even more advanced sales skills. Everybody won: new hires got more training and attention, veterans got more
attention from me, and I could spend my own time on higher value work (such
as coaching veterans on their career path instead of teaching new hires how to
use Salesforce.com). The team leads didn’t do all of the coaching themselves; they were responsible
for ensuring a new hire on their sub-team was trained and coached. After that I
would then come in and spend more time with them, when they were ready for
more advanced one-on-one coaching. To align their goals with the goals of their sub-team, 20% of a team lead’s goals
and compensation depended on the whole sub-team’s results. This 20% was
extra compensation for taking on the responsibility of being a team lead. The other 80% of a team lead’s compensation depended on their individual sales
performance.",
3485,Predictable Revenue,"Some of the other functions that the sub-teams and team leads owned included:
Quality control of the work produced (we had an audit process to verify
sales results and deals before approving them as commissionable). Small incentive/marketing budgets for their sub-team. Fun activities for their sub-team. Interviewing and training of new hires in their sub-team. Peer reviews of each other. Monthly achievement of sub-team sales goals. I focused much of my time on coaching the team leads—training the trainers. As
part of that, I still walked around and talked and sat with everyone, including
new hires. Staying connected to the trenches gave me more insight into how to
better help the team leads and improve our systems. How To Distribute Responsibilities
You need to distribute responsibilities throughout the team (or to outside the
team) in ways that don’t add a lot of extra work; hence the importance of
elimination, automation and outsourcing before delegation.",
3486,Predictable Revenue,"By distributing responsibilities to the employees touching customers, the ones
closest to the action, you can get better quality work and results. They will also
learn much more about the business and what it takes to succeed as miniCEOs. Here are some examples of distributing some common VP Sales responsibilities:
Goal Setting:
What conditions would have to exist for the team to be able to set and achieve its
own goals better than before? 80/20 rule: How much of the goals-setting process isn’t that important? Do
you really need to set and track 15 goals? What are the 20% of the goals
that matter the most? What if you have a “Goals Setting Lead” on the team to be the point person
to manage the process, both within the team and with the CEO? Do you need a separate “Quota Beating Lead” to monitor and report on the
teams overall progress each month, and flag areas of concern?",
3487,Predictable Revenue,"Senior Help On Big Deals:
If you have to throw your VP Sales (or yourself) at every big deal, you don’t
have a scalable sales process, and that one person will always be a bottleneck. In
fact, any time a single person is a bottleneck to any process, your growth is
capped. What conditions would have to exist for 80% of your current big deals
to close without help from the VP Sales or CEO? Can you enhance your sales process or product to reduce the need for VP
Sales involvement? To make deals easier to win without as much help? Which other senior executives can be placed “on call” to step into big
deals? Could customers who love you contribute some of their time to helping
you? (Yes, this can happen, especially if you have a special privileges
program for them.)
Sales Reporting And Analysis:
What conditions would have to exist for the team and executives to get all the
reports and analysis they need with the click of a button?",
3488,Predictable Revenue,"By publishing the sales results in real-time, such as with an application like
Salesforce.com, can you eliminate the need for someone to do reporting
altogether? Be aware of data-addiction: Which reports are nice-to-have versus need-to-
have? It is common for executives and board members who ask for reports
to forget that many take considerable time and energy to produce, and that
time isn’t free because it takes people away from the business. Rather than
blindly producing reports, ask them their business goal for the report. Maybe they need something other than what they want. Help executives
understand the cost of the reports they want, so they can prioritize their
requests. How can you redesign your reports to be more useful? Reports are often
created just because someone wants it without a clear idea of its purpose. Ask, “What decision will this report help you make better?",
3489,Predictable Revenue,"What is the goal
of this report?” If a report doesn’t help you prioritize your energies or make
better decisions, something’s wrong with it. Culture:
A lot of companies like to talk about culture, but then actually do little about it. Often it’s little more than another coercion tool foisted on employees to “Get
your head in the game” and “Be a part of the team.” How much do you do to
encourage and develop a positive culture that attracts and supports great people? What conditions would have to exist for the culture to identify and practice its
key values? Example:
If having fun is important to your culture(and it better be!), the team could
have a Fun Lead who would be accountable for the team having fun each
week. No, “accountable fun” is not an oxymoron. When people are busy,
it’s easy to forget to have fun.",
3490,Predictable Revenue,"Again, that person may or may not be the person organizing events,
instigating practical jokes, or starting impromptu office karaoke sessions—
they only need to make sure it happens regularly. Never Give Up
Why can it feel hard to develop self-managing people and teams? Assuming you
have hired good people (which is frequently not the case), a main cause of
failure is giving up too soon. This requires patience and practice. For some of you, it might take six weeks to make a team self-managing. For
others, it could be six years. But if you give up along the way, you for sure will
never make it happen. Stay committed to it and never give up! For

Even though I retained some core responsibilities—comp plan design,
V2MOM/vision planning, annual planning — I still gave everyone the option of
getting involved in those functions, if they wanted to.",
3491,Predictable Revenue,"Involving employees (or
giving them the option of involvement) in the creation of everything is vital to
inspiring them to care about the business as much as you do. For example, at one point several sales team members were expressing
frustration about the design of the compensation plan, which had three
components:
A fixed base salary,
A 
variable 
commission 
based 
on 
how 
many 
qualified 
(and
audited/confirmed) opportunities that person generated in a month, and
A variable commission based on how much revenue had been sourced by
that person. The complaints were a little varied but ultimately came down to the fact that I
hadn’t taken enough time to educate some of the newer sales reps on why we
had that system. Rather than even telling them why it was designed that way, I instead set up a
process to get the team’s help to revisit and redesign the comp plan. Out of about
15 people at the time, 5 opted-in to help.",
3492,Predictable Revenue,"We had one main session to dig into the issue, to review the team’s priorities and
goals (identified through the V2MOM process), and to create a forum for them
to share their ideas on how to better shape the comp plan to support the goals. After a couple hours of discussion, which included revisiting even the basic
assumptions surrounding how we measured performance and success, and if we
should use different metrics, the team came to the conclusion that the current
comp plan was the best one. Rather than just telling them why the comp plan evolved into its current form, I
led them through their own discovery process. They “got it” and the complaints
stopped. Even better, they could be much more effective in teaching other team
members or new hires about the comp plan so these frustrations didn’t pop up
again with the next generation of new team members. We ended up in the same
place we began: the comp plan didn’t change.",
3493,Predictable Revenue,"One could feel like we wasted
time, but I felt it was a fantastic use of time as a coaching exercise and as a way
to increase trust and transparency in the team. The reps felt more connected to
the team and the systems because they now understood more intimately where
everything came from and why—they owned it. My only disappointment was that I had hoped they would come up with
something I had missed so we could improve the plan! Transparent Compensation And Reporting
I had a convenient advantage that helped me transparently publish everyone’s
compensation on the team: they all were on the same basic plan structure (same
base salary, same bonus and commission rates). No one had special deals even
though some people had much more experience than others. Those with more
experience or expectations could earn the extra compensation through higher
results.",
3494,Predictable Revenue,"With transparency compensation, the whole team could see who earned the most
and why—how their higher results translated directly into more money. Publishing compensation also eliminated compensation and payroll errors, and
reduced by 80% the amount of time I had to spend on tracking and reporting
compensation. If you haven’t tracked and reported on compensation, it’s a pain. For a long time, we used spreadsheets at Salesforce.com to report
commissionable results. The secrecy model:
Run the reports: What were each person’s results? Prepare the report and calculate commissions. Cut the report into private reports for each person. Email or sit with each person to share results and ensure correctness. Fix the report as necessary. Combine all the results into one spreadsheet. Send to finance. And that is when it works!",
3495,Predictable Revenue,"If there is some issue in the report or with finance, the
process gets into a painful circle of “fix-resend-check-fix-resend-check…”
When the team grew past a handful of people, I started using transparency to
eliminate 80% of this work and streamline the process. I put all the sales results into a single spreadsheet, with the calculated
commissions. I then emailed the entire sheet to the whole team. Everyone could see everyone’s
results, and how they personally ranked. Yes, everyone could see on our Salesforce.com dashboards how they ranked in
numbers of opportunities or deals, but in the spreadsheet they could rank
themselves by total compensation. They could see exactly who was doing the best and thus whom they could model
or go to for advice (we had a culture of helping each other succeed). They could see if there were any problems with the report.",
3496,Predictable Revenue,"They felt confident
that they would get the right paycheck from finance, which is not true for many
organizations—compensation payment issues are all-too common. They could trust in the process and not worry about it, because we were open
and transparent with it. Ultimately, switching to this transparent process made comp reporting a snap for
me and for them! I never took it to the next level, which would have been to have someone
volunteer to be the Comp Lead, to manage the reporting and processing for me. But that would have been an easy next step. 10 Ways To Improve Sales Force Automation
Adoption
Sales Force Automation systems like Salesforce.com are ESSENTIAL tools; but
like any tool, it's only as valuable as the proficiency with which it is used. As
easy to use as Salesforce.com is - and other systems can be - many companies
still struggle to get their people to use them. Three Core Adoption Values

Adoption starts with the CEO and executive team. As a rule of thumb, users will
only adopt as far as their managers do, and managers will adopt only as far as
the executives do. 2. Better design = better adoption
The easier you make it for people to adopt (cleaner interface, comprehensive
training, initial handholding), the more they will. 3. Peer pressure and collaboration work
Starting with the executive team, everyone needs to expect your SFA system will
be used. Ask, “Why isn't this in our sales system?” until you're sick of even
hearing yourself. Bring meetings to a halt until the sales system is updated
NOW. 10 Ways To Increase Adoption Of Your Sales Force Automation (“SFA”)
System
1. Set up a useful CEO/executive team dashboard, PLUS include a slot in the
executive meeting to review the dashboard. 2. Clean up your SFA clutter to improve usability. 3. Make compensation dependent on accurate reports in your system. 4.",
3498,Predictable Revenue,"Clearly communicate why SFA adoption matters. 5. Customize the user interface for your people by role. 6. Start training and creating expectations Day One with new hires. 7. Make adoption a part of sales culture and peer pressure. 8. Take an online training class for your sales force automation system. 9. Hire an experienced SFA user of your system to do one-onone training
sessions with your people. 10. Evaluate a mobile smartphone version of your SFA system. Explanations
1. Set up a useful CEO/executive team dashboard, PLUS include a slot in
the executive meeting to review the dashboard. What metrics are currently tracked in weekly executive meetings? Translate
these out of Excel and into a SFA dashboard (where possible), using the
dashboard as the basis of that part of the meeting. No exceptions. This will
create a top-down effect that will greatly help in inspiring adoption! Start simple, with a single first dashboard and only the top 8-10 metrics the team
cares about.",

this quarter, Number of leads qualified this month, Pipeline created this month,
Results per vertical, etc. 2. Clean up your SFA clutter to improve usability. Stop trying to track EVERYTHING. The easier your SFA system is to use, the
more people will use it. Get rid of the clutter, mostly by hiding things people
don’t use and keeping labels intuitive:
Hide unused tabs. Hide or remove unused data fields. Use simple, common sense names for custom fields. 3. Make compensation dependent on reports in your SFA system. Don’t pay people if the sales opportunity or customer isn't in your SFA system,
or if it's not filled out to pre-defined standards. You'll be amazed at how quickly
opportunities move into your SFA system! 4. Clearly communicate why SFA adoption matters. Studies have shown that when you clearly communicate why you want
something, people are much more likely to cooperate.",
3500,Predictable Revenue,"Without data in your SFA system, the executive team must either navigate blindly
or extract data manually... You won’t get much cooperation from salespeople if they feel like you only want
them to use the SFA because you want to keep tabs on them. But if they know
why it’s good business for them to use it, they will…
Without data in your SFA system, the executive team must either navigate
blindly or extract data manually from people, hurting the sales team in either
case. Sales reps will waste time as teammates (pre-sales, inside sales) struggle or
make mistakes because of inaccurate or incomplete views of accounts and their
status. Customers will be more likely to receive poor service, as customer
support won't have a clear picture of what's going on with the account. 5. Customize the user interface for your people by role.",
