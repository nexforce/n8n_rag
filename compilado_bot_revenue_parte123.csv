irrelevant and distracting. 6. Start training and creating expectations Day One with new hires. Make a first impression and reinforce the idea that everything should and does
live in the SFA. Start them with good habits. 7. Make it a part of sales culture and peer pressure. ""If it's not in the SFA system, it doesn't exist."" If management holds a high
standard of expectations and doesn’t cheat, reps will improve. Example: On a pipeline call, if a rep hasn't entered or updated a deal, make the
team wait while they update it in real-time (assuming they're at a computer). Again, don’t pay people for deals that are not in the system. 8. Take an online SFA training class. Whatever system you have, there are different kinds of classes—take them!",
3502,Predictable Revenue,"While in a perfect world you could use a system just by looking at it and it
would be totally intuitive, until Apple gets into this market, you will have to take
training. 9. Have experienced SFA users do one-on-one training sessions. I've found that many users of SFA systems are, for the most part, just intimidated
by a “new system.” Sitting down with them for a couple of half-hour sessions, to
show them just a few useful tips, is enough to get them over the main first hump. 10. Evaluate a mobile smartphone version of your SFA system. Would SFA on Blackberries/iPhones make it more accessible? Especially for
salespeople on the road who have little time to update things on a laptop, this can
be an easy way to give them access to make small, yet important, updates or to
access data in the system from anyplace at anytime. Remember, it's not just the responsibility of the software you choose to make
you successful, or the sales reps themselves.",
3503,Predictable Revenue,"The CEO bears the most responsibility here in also using it and staying
committed to doing whatever it takes to help the company embrace it and use it
effectively. Sell - don't command - people on the value and vision of what it will be like to
have it embraced! Who's Responsibility Is Adoption? Ultimately, it's not the responsibility of the software you choose to make you
successful. It's also not the sales reps' responsibility or sales managers, although they of
course are very important to adoption. Who bears the ultimate responsibility for successfully deploying and adopting a
sales system? The CEO (or business division leader). The teams will follow the CEOs lead: if you use your sales system, the company
will. If you don't use it, they won't. You must lead by example. Sell - don't command - people on the value and vision of what it will be like to

sometimes. Just don’t stop taking them. Become unstoppable. While the Cold Calling 2.0 process is simple, sticking to it and ingraining it in
your culture may not be. Change is hard for people and companies. Commitment Is The Key:
“Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back--
Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation), there is one elementary
truth that ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that
the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too. All
sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred.",

CHAPTER 1
THE NEW RULES
I was intimidated.",
3519,Never split the difference,"I’d spent more than two decades in the FBI, including
fifteen years negotiating hostage situations from New York
to the Philippines and the Middle East, and I was on top of
my game. At any given time, there are ten thousand FBI
agents in the Bureau, but only one lead international
kidnapping negotiator. That was me. But I’d never experienced a hostage situation so tense,
so personal. “We’ve got your son, Voss. Give us one million dollars
or he dies.”
Pause. Blink. Mindfully urge the heart rate back to
normal. Sure, I’d been in these types of situations before. Tons of
them. Money for lives. But not like this. Not with my son on
the line. Not $1 million. And not against people with fancy
degrees and a lifetime of negotiating expertise. You see, the people across the table—my negotiating
counterparts—were 
Harvard 
Law 
School 
negotiating
professors.",
3520,Never split the difference,"I’d come up to Harvard to take a short executive negotiating
course, to see if I could learn something from the business
world’s approach. It was supposed to be quiet and calm, a
little professional development for an FBI guy trying to
widen his horizons. But when Robert Mnookin, the director of the Harvard
Negotiation Research Project, learned I was on campus, he
invited me to his office for a coffee. Just to chat, he said. I was honored. And scared. Mnookin is an impressive
guy whom I’d followed for years: not only is he a Harvard
law professor, he’s also one of the big shots of the conflict
resolution field and the author of Bargaining with the Devil:
When to Negotiate, When to Fight.1
To be honest, it felt unfair that Mnookin wanted me, a
former Kansas City beat cop, to debate negotiation with
him. But then it got worse. Just after Mnookin and I sat
down, the door opened and another Harvard professor
walked in.",
3521,Never split the difference,"It was Gabriella Blum, a specialist in international
negotiations, armed conflict, and counterterrorism, who’d
spent eight years as a negotiator for the Israeli National
Security Council and the Israel Defense Forces. The tough-
as-nails IDF. On cue, Mnookin’s secretary arrived and put a tape
recorder on the table. Mnookin and Blum smiled at me. I’d been tricked. “We’ve got your son, Voss. Give us one million dollars
or he dies,” Mnookin said, smiling. “I’m the kidnapper. What are you going to do?”
I experienced a flash of panic, but that was to be
expected. It never changes: even after two decades
negotiating for human lives you still feel fear. Even in a
role-playing situation. I calmed myself down. Sure, I was a street cop turned
FBI agent playing against real heavyweights. And I wasn’t a
genius. But I was in this room for a reason.",
3522,Never split the difference,"Over the years I
had picked up skills, tactics, and a whole approach to
human interaction that had not just helped me save lives but,
as I recognize now looking back, had also begun to
transform my own life. My years of negotiating had infused
everything from how I dealt with customer service reps to
my parenting style. “C’mon. Get me the money or I cut your son’s throat
right now,” Mnookin said. Testy. I gave him a long, slow stare. Then I smiled. “How am I supposed to do that?”
Mnookin paused. His expression had a touch of amused
pity in it, like a dog when the cat it’s been chasing turns
around and tries to chase it back. It was as if we were
playing different games, with different rules. Mnookin regained his composure and eyed me with
arched brows as if to remind me that we were still playing. “So you’re okay with me killing your son, Mr.",
3523,Never split the difference,"Voss?”
“I’m sorry, Robert, how do I know he’s even alive?” I
said, using an apology and his first name, seeding more
warmth into the interaction in order to complicate his gambit
to bulldoze me. “I really am sorry, but how can I get you
any money right now, much less one million dollars, if I
don’t even know he’s alive?”
It was quite a sight to see such a brilliant man flustered
by what must have seemed unsophisticated foolishness. On
the contrary, though, my move was anything but foolish. I
was employing what had become one of the FBI’s most
potent negotiating tools: the open-ended question. Today, after some years evolving these tactics for the
private sector in my consultancy, The Black Swan Group,
we call this tactic calibrated questions: queries that the other
side can respond to but that have no fixed answers. It buys
you time.",
3524,Never split the difference,"It gives your counterpart the illusion of control—
they are the one with the answers and power after all—and it
does all that without giving them any idea of how
constrained they are by it. Mnookin, predictably, started fumbling because the
frame of the conversation had shifted from how I’d respond
to the threat of my son’s murder to how the professor would
deal with the logistical issues involved in getting the money. How he would solve my problems. To every threat and
demand he made, I continued to ask how I was supposed to
pay him and how was I supposed to know that my son was
alive. After we’d been doing that for three minutes, Gabriella
Blum interjected. “Don’t let him do that to you,” she said to Mnookin. “Well, you try,” he said, throwing up his hands. Blum dove in. She was tougher from her years in the
Middle East. But she was still doing the bulldozer angle, and
all she got were my same questions. Mnookin rejoined the session, but he got nowhere either.",
3525,Never split the difference,"His face started to get red with frustration. I could tell the
irritation was making it hard to think. “Okay, okay, Bob. That’s all,” I said, putting him out of
his misery. He nodded. My son would live to see another day. “Fine,” he said. “I suppose the FBI might have
something to teach us.”
I had done more than just hold my own against two of
Harvard’s distinguished leaders. I had taken on the best of
the best and come out on top. But was it just a fluke? For more than three decades,
Harvard had been the world epicenter of negotiating theory
and practice. All I knew about the techniques we used at the
FBI was that they worked. In the twenty years I spent at the
Bureau we’d designed a system that had successfully
resolved almost every kidnapping we applied it to. But we
didn’t have grand theories. Our techniques were the products of experiential
learning; they were developed by agents in the field,
negotiating through crisis and sharing stories of what
succeeded and what failed.",
3526,Never split the difference,"It was an iterative process, not
an intellectual one, as we refined the tools we used day after
day. And it was urgent. Our tools had to work, because if
they didn’t someone died. But why did they work? That was the question that drew
me to Harvard, to that office with Mnookin and Blum. I
lacked confidence outside my narrow world. Most of all, I
needed to articulate my knowledge and learn how to
combine it with theirs—and they clearly had some—so I
could understand, systematize, and expand it. Yes, our techniques clearly worked with mercenaries,
drug dealers, terrorists, and brutal killers. But, I wondered,
what about with normal humans? As I’d soon discover in the storied halls of Harvard, our
techniques made great sense intellectually, and they worked
everywhere. It turned out that our approach to negotiation held the
keys to unlock profitable human interactions in every
domain and every interaction and every relationship in life. This book is how it works.",
3527,Never split the difference,"THE SMARTEST DUMB GUY IN THE ROOM
To answer my questions, a year later, in 2006, I talked my
way into Harvard Law School’s Winter Negotiation Course. The best and brightest compete to get into this class, and it
was filled with brilliant Harvard students getting law and
business degrees and hotshot students from other top Boston
universities like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and Tufts. The Olympic trials for negotiating. And I was the
only outsider. The first day of the course, all 144 of us piled into a
lecture hall for an introduction and then we split into four
groups, each led by a negotiation instructor. After we’d had
a chat with our instructor—mine was named Sheila Heen,
and she’s a good buddy to this day—we were partnered off
in pairs and sent into mock negotiations. Simple: one of us
was selling a product, the other was the buyer, and each had
clear limits on the price they could take.",
3528,Never split the difference,"My counterpart was a languid redhead named Andy (a
pseudonym), one of those guys who wear their intellectual
superiority like they wear their khakis: with relaxed
confidence. He and I went into an empty classroom
overlooking one of those English-style squares on Harvard’s
campus, and we each used the tools we had. Andy would
throw out an offer and give a rationally airtight explanation
for why it was a good one—an inescapable logic trap—and
I’d answer with some variation of “How am I supposed to
do that?”
We did this a bunch of times until we got to a final
figure. When we left, I was happy. I thought I’d done pretty
well for a dumb guy. After we all regrouped in the classroom, Sheila went
around the students and asked what price each group had
agreed on, and then wrote the result on the board. Finally, it was my turn. “Chris, how did you do with Andy?” she asked. “How
much did you get?”
I’ll never forget Sheila’s expression when I told her what
Andy had agreed to pay.",
3529,Never split the difference,"Her whole face first went red, as if
she couldn’t breathe, and then out popped a little strangled
gasp like a baby bird’s hungry cry. Finally, she started to
laugh. Andy squirmed. “You got literally every dime he had,” she said, “and in
his brief he was supposed to hold a quarter of it back in
reserve for future work.”
Andy sank deep in his chair. The next day the same thing happened with another partner. I mean, I absolutely destroyed the guy’s budget. It didn’t make sense. A lucky one-off was one thing. But
this was a pattern. With my old-school, experiential
knowledge, I was killing guys who knew every cutting-edge
trick you could find in a book. The thing was, it was the cutting-edge techniques these
guys were using that felt dated and old. I felt like I was
Roger Federer and I had used a time machine to go back to
the 1920s to play in a tennis tournament of distinguished
gentlemen who wore white pantsuits and used wood rackets
and had part-time training regimens.",
3530,Never split the difference,"There I was with my
titanium alloy racket and dedicated personal trainer and
computer-strategized serve-and-volley plays. The guys I
was playing were just as smart—actually, more so—and we
were basically playing the same game with the same rules. But I had skills they didn’t. “You’re getting famous for your special style, Chris,”
Sheila said, after I announced my second day’s results. I smiled like the Cheshire cat. Winning was fun. “Chris, why don’t you tell everybody your approach,”
Sheila said. “It seems like all you do to these Harvard Law
School students is say ‘No’ and stare at them, and they fall
apart. Is it really that easy?”
I knew what she meant: While I wasn’t actually saying
“No,” the questions I kept asking sounded like it. They
seemed to insinuate that the other side was being dishonest
and unfair. And that was enough to make them falter and
negotiate with themselves.",
3531,Never split the difference,"Answering my calibrated
questions demanded deep emotional strengths and tactical
psychological insights that the toolbox they’d been given
did not contain. I shrugged. “I’m just asking questions,” I said. “It’s a passive-
aggressive approach. I just ask the same three or four open-
ended questions over and over and over and over. They get
worn out answering and give me everything I want.”
Andy jumped in his seat as if he’d been stung by a bee. “Damn!” he said. “That’s what happened. I had no
idea.”
By the time I’d finished my winter course at Harvard, I’d
actually become friends with some of my fellow students. Even with Andy. If my time at Harvard showed me anything, it was that
we at the FBI had a lot to teach the world about negotiating.",
3532,Never split the difference,"In my short stay I realized that without a deep
understanding 
of 
human 
psychology, 
without 
the
acceptance that we are all crazy, irrational, impulsive,
emotionally driven animals, all the raw intelligence and
mathematical logic in the world is little help in the fraught,
shifting interplay of two people negotiating. Yes, perhaps we are the only animal that haggles—a
monkey does not exchange a portion of his banana for
another’s nuts—but no matter how we dress up our
negotiations in mathematical theories, we are always an
animal, always acting and reacting first and foremost from
our deeply held but mostly invisible and inchoate fears,
needs, perceptions, and desires. That’s not how these folks at Harvard learned it, though. Their theories and techniques all had to do with intellectual
power, logic, authoritative acronyms like BATNA and
ZOPA, rational notions of value, and a moral concept of
what was fair and what was not.",
3533,Never split the difference,"And built on top of this false edifice of rationality was,
of course, process. They had a script to follow, a
predetermined sequence of actions, offers, and counteroffers
designed in a specific order to bring about a particular
outcome. It was as if they were dealing with a robot, that if
you did a, b, c, and d in a certain fixed order, you would get
x. But in the real world negotiation is far too unpredictable
and complex for that. You may have to do a then d, and
then maybe q. If I could dominate the country’s brightest students with
just one of the many emotionally attuned negotiating
techniques I had developed and used against terrorists and
kidnappers, why not apply them to business? What was the
difference between bank robbers who took hostages and
CEOs who used hardball tactics to drive down the price of a
billion-dollar acquisition? After all, kidnappers are just businessmen trying to get
the best price.",
3534,Never split the difference,"OLD-SCHOOL NEGOTIATION
Hostage taking—and therefore hostage negotiating—has
existed since the dawn of recorded time. The Old Testament
spins plenty of tales of Israelites and their enemies taking
each other’s citizens hostage as spoils of war. The Romans,
for their part, used to force the princes of vassal states to
send their sons to Rome for their education, to ensure the
continued loyalty of the princes. But until the Nixon administration, hostage negotiating
as a process was limited to sending in troops and trying to
shoot the hostages free. In law enforcement, our approach
was pretty much to talk until we figured out how to take
them out with a gun. Brute force. Then a series of hostage disasters forced us to change. In 1971, thirty-nine hostages were killed when the police
tried to resolve the Attica prison riots in upstate New York
with guns.",
3535,Never split the difference,"Then at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, eleven
Israeli athletes and coaches were killed by their Palestinian
captors after a botched rescue attempt by the German police. But the greatest inspiration for institutional change in
American law enforcement came on an airport tarmac in
Jacksonville, Florida, on October 4, 1971. The United States was experiencing an epidemic of
airline hijackings at the time; there were five in one three-
day period in 1970. It was in that charged atmosphere that
an unhinged man named George Giffe Jr. hijacked a
chartered plane out of Nashville, Tennessee, planning to
head to the Bahamas. By the time the incident was over, Giffe had murdered
two hostages—his estranged wife and the pilot—and killed
himself to boot. But this time the blame didn’t fall on the hijacker;
instead, it fell squarely on the FBI. Two hostages had
managed to convince Giffe to let them go on the tarmac in
Jacksonville, where they’d stopped to refuel.",
3536,Never split the difference,"But the agents
had gotten impatient and shot out the engine. And that had
pushed Giffe to the nuclear option. In fact, the blame placed on the FBI was so strong that
when the pilot’s wife and Giffe’s daughter filed a wrongful
death suit alleging FBI negligence, the courts agreed. In the landmark Downs v. United States decision of
1975, the U.S. Court of Appeals wrote that “there was a
better suited alternative to protecting the hostages’ well-
being,” and said that the FBI had turned “what had been a
successful ‘waiting game,’ during which two persons safely
left the plane, into a ‘shooting match’ that left three persons
dead.” The court concluded that “a reasonable attempt at
negotiations must be made prior to a tactical intervention.”
The Downs hijacking case came to epitomize everything
not to do in a crisis situation, and inspired the development
of today’s theories, training, and techniques for hostage
negotiations.",
3537,Never split the difference,"Soon after the Giffe tragedy, the New York City Police
Department (NYPD) became the first police force in the
country to put together a dedicated team of specialists to
design a process and handle crisis negotiations. The FBI and
others followed. A new era of negotiation had begun. HEART VS. MIND
In the early 1980s, Cambridge, Massachusetts, was the hot
spot in the negotiating world, as scholars from different
disciplines began interacting and exploring exciting new
concepts. The big leap forward came in 1979, when the
Harvard Negotiation Project was founded with a mandate to
improve the theory, teaching, and practice of negotiation so
that people could more effectively handle everything from
peace treaties to business mergers. Two years later, Roger Fisher and William Ury—
cofounders of the project—came out with Getting to Yes,2 a
groundbreaking treatise on negotiation that totally changed
the way practitioners thought about the field.",
3538,Never split the difference,"Fisher and Ury’s approach was basically to systematize
problem solving so that negotiating parties could reach a
mutually beneficial deal—the getting to “Yes” in the title. Their core assumption was that the emotional brain—that
animalistic, unreliable, and irrational beast—could be
overcome through a more rational, joint problem-solving
mindset. Their system was easy to follow and seductive, with four
basic tenets. One, separate the person—the emotion—from
the problem; two, don’t get wrapped up in the other side’s
position (what they’re asking for) but instead focus on their
interests (why they’re asking for it) so that you can find what
they really want; three, work cooperatively to generate win-
win options; and, four, establish mutually agreed-upon
standards for evaluating those possible solutions. It was a brilliant, rational, and profound synthesis of the
most advanced game theory and legal thinking of the day.",
3539,Never split the difference,"For years after that book came out, everybody—including
the FBI and the NYPD—focused on a problem-solving
approach to bargaining interactions. It just seemed so
modern and smart. Halfway across the United States, a pair of professors at the
University of Chicago was looking at everything from
economics to negotiation from a far different angle. They were the economist Amos Tversky and the
psychologist Daniel Kahneman. Together, the two launched
the field of behavioral economics—and Kahneman won a
Nobel Prize—by showing that man is a very irrational beast. Feeling, they discovered, is a form of thinking. As you’ve seen, when business schools like Harvard’s
began teaching negotiation in the 1980s, the process was
presented as a straightforward economic analysis.",
3540,Never split the difference,"It was a
period when the world’s top academic economists declared
that we were all “rational actors.” And so it went in
negotiation classes: assuming the other side was acting
rationally and selfishly in trying to maximize its position, the
goal was to figure out how to respond in various scenarios
to maximize one’s own value. This mentality baffled Kahneman, who from years in
psychology knew that, in his words, “[I]t is self-evident that
people are neither fully rational nor completely selfish, and
that their tastes are anything but stable.”
Through decades of research with Tversky, Kahneman
proved that humans all suffer from Cognitive Bias, that is,
unconscious—and irrational—brain processes that literally
distort the way we see the world. Kahneman and Tversky
discovered more than 150 of them.",
3541,Never split the difference,"There’s the Framing Effect, which demonstrates that
people respond differently to the same choice depending on
how it is framed (people place greater value on moving
from 90 percent to 100 percent—high probability to
certainty—than from 45 percent to 55 percent, even though
they’re both ten percentage points). Prospect Theory
explains why we take unwarranted risks in the face of
uncertain losses. And the most famous is Loss Aversion,
which shows how people are statistically more likely to act
to avert a loss than to achieve an equal gain. Kahneman later codified his research in the 2011
bestseller Thinking, Fast and Slow.3 Man, he wrote, has two
systems of thought: System 1, our animal mind, is fast,
instinctive, and emotional; System 2 is slow, deliberative,
and logical. And System 1 is far more influential. In fact, it
guides and steers our rational thoughts.",
3542,Never split the difference,"System 1’s inchoate beliefs, feelings, and impressions
are the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate
choices of System 2. They’re the spring that feeds the river. We react emotionally (System 1) to a suggestion or
question. Then that System 1 reaction informs and in effect
creates the System 2 answer. Now think about that: under this model, if you know
how to affect your counterpart’s System 1 thinking, his
inarticulate feelings, by how you frame and deliver your
questions and statements, then you can guide his System 2
rationality and therefore modify his responses. That’s what
happened to Andy at Harvard: by asking, “How am I
supposed to do that?” I influenced his System 1 emotional
mind into accepting that his offer wasn’t good enough; his
System 2 then rationalized the situation so that it made sense
to give me a better offer.",
3543,Never split the difference,"If you believed Kahneman, conducting negotiations
based on System 2 concepts without the tools to read,
understand, and manipulate the System 1 emotional
underpinning was like trying to make an omelet without first
knowing how to crack an egg. THE FBI GETS EMOTIONAL
As the new hostage negotiating team at the FBI grew and
gained more experience in problem-solving skills during the
1980s and ’90s, it became clear that our system was lacking
a crucial ingredient. At the time, we were deep into Getting to Yes. And as a
negotiator, consultant, and teacher with decades of
experience, I still agree with many of the powerful
bargaining strategies in the book. When it was published, it
provided groundbreaking ideas on cooperative problem
solving and originated absolutely necessary concepts like
entering negotiations with a BATNA: the Best Alternative
To a Negotiated Agreement. It was genius.",
3544,Never split the difference,"But after the fatally disastrous sieges of Randy Weaver’s
Ruby Ridge farm in Idaho in 1992 and David Koresh’s
Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, in 1993, there
was no denying that most hostage negotiations were
anything but rational problem-solving situations. I mean, have you ever tried to devise a mutually
beneficial win-win solution with a guy who thinks he’s the
messiah? It was becoming glaringly obvious that Getting to Yes
didn’t work with kidnappers. No matter how many agents
read the book with highlighters in hand, it failed to improve
how we as hostage negotiators approached deal making. There was clearly a breakdown between the book’s
brilliant theory and everyday law enforcement experience. Why was it that everyone had read this bestselling business
book and endorsed it as one of the greatest negotiation texts
ever written, and yet so few could actually follow it
successfully? Were we morons? After Ruby Ridge and Waco, a lot of people were asking
that question. U.S.",
3545,Never split the difference,"deputy attorney general Philip B. Heymann, to be specific, wanted to know why our hostage
negotiation techniques were so bad. In October 1993, he
issued a report titled “Lessons of Waco: Proposed Changes
in Federal Law Enforcement,”4 which summarized an
expert panel’s diagnosis of federal law enforcement’s
inability to handle complex hostage situations. As a result, in 1994 FBI director Louis Freeh announced
the formation of the Critical Incident Response Group
(CIRG), a blended division that would combine the Crises
Negotiation, Crises Management, Behavioral Sciences, and
Hostage Rescue teams and reinvent crisis negotiation. The only issue was, what techniques were we going to
use?",
3546,Never split the difference,"Around this time, two of the most decorated negotiators in
FBI history, my colleague Fred Lanceley and my former
boss Gary Noesner, were leading a hostage negotiation class
in Oakland, California, when they asked their group of
thirty-five experienced law enforcement officers a simple
question: How many had dealt with a classic bargaining
situation where problem solving was the best technique? Not one hand went up. Then they asked the complementary question: How
many students had negotiated an incident in a dynamic,
intense, uncertain environment where the hostage-taker was
in emotional crisis and had no clear demands? Every hand went up. It was clear: if emotionally driven incidents, not rational
bargaining interactions, constituted the bulk of what most
police negotiators had to deal with, then our negotiating
skills had to laser-focus on the animal, emotional, and
irrational.",
3547,Never split the difference,"From that moment onward, our emphasis would have to
be not on training in quid pro quo bargaining and problem
solving, but on education in the psychological skills needed
in crisis intervention situations. Emotions and emotional
intelligence would have to be central to effective
negotiation, not things to be overcome. What were needed were simple psychological tactics and
strategies that worked in the field to calm people down,
establish rapport, gain trust, elicit the verbalization of needs,
and persuade the other guy of our empathy. We needed
something easy to teach, easy to learn, and easy to execute. These were cops and agents, after all, and they weren’t
interested in becoming academics or therapists. What they
wanted was to change the behavior of the hostage-taker,
whoever they were and whatever they wanted, to shift the
emotional environment of the crisis just enough so that we
could secure the safety of everyone involved.",
3548,Never split the difference,"In the early years, the FBI experimented with both new and
old therapeutic techniques developed by the counseling
profession. These counseling skills were aimed at
developing 
positive 
relationships 
with 
people 
by
demonstrating an understanding of what they’re going
through and how they feel about it. It all starts with the universally applicable premise that
people want to be understood and accepted. Listening is the
cheapest, yet most effective concession we can make to get
there. By listening intensely, a negotiator demonstrates
empathy and shows a sincere desire to better understand
what the other side is experiencing. Psychotherapy research shows that when individuals feel
listened to, they tend to listen to themselves more carefully
and to openly evaluate and clarify their own thoughts and
feelings.",
3549,Never split the difference,"In addition, they tend to become less defensive and
oppositional and more willing to listen to other points of
view, which gets them to the calm and logical place where
they can be good Getting to Yes problem solvers. The whole concept, which you’ll learn as the centerpiece
of this book, is called Tactical Empathy. This is listening as
a martial art, balancing the subtle behaviors of emotional
intelligence and the assertive skills of influence, to gain
access to the mind of another person. Contrary to popular
opinion, listening is not a passive activity. It is the most
active thing you can do. Once we started developing our new techniques, the
negotiating world split into two currents: negotiation as
learned at the country’s top school continued down the
established road of rational problem solving, while,
ironically, we meatheads at the FBI began to train our agents
in an unproven system based on psychology, counseling,
and crisis intervention.",
3550,Never split the difference,"While the Ivy League taught math
and economics, we became experts in empathy. And our way worked. LIFE IS NEGOTIATION
While you might be curious how FBI negotiators get some
of the world’s toughest bad guys to give up their hostages,
you could be excused for wondering what hostage
negotiation has to do with your life. Happily, very few
people are ever forced to deal with Islamist terrorists who’ve
kidnapped their loved ones. But allow me to let you in on a secret: Life is
negotiation. The majority of the interactions we have at work and at
home are negotiations that boil down to the expression of a
simple, animalistic urge: I want. “I want you to free the hostages,” is a very relevant one
to this book, of course.",
3551,Never split the difference,"But so is:
“I want you to accept that $1 million contract.”
“I want to pay $20,000 for that car.”
“I want you to give me a 10 percent raise.”
and
“I want you to go to sleep at 9 p.m.”
Negotiation serves two distinct, vital life functions—
information gathering and behavior influencing—and
includes almost any interaction where each party wants
something from the other side. Your career, your finances,
your reputation, your love life, even the fate of your kids—
at some point all of these hinge on your ability to negotiate. Negotiation as you’ll learn it here is nothing more than
communication with results. Getting what you want out of
life is all about getting what you want from—and with—
other people. Conflict between two parties is inevitable in all
relationships. So it’s useful—crucial, even—to know how to
engage in that conflict to get what you want without
inflicting damage.",
3552,Never split the difference,"In this book, I draw on my more than two-decade career
in the Federal Bureau of Investigation to distill the principles
and practices I deployed in the field into an exciting new
approach designed to help you disarm, redirect, and
dismantle your counterpart in virtually any negotiation. And
to do so in a relationship-affirming way. Yes, you’ll learn how we negotiated the safe release of
countless hostages. But you’ll also learn how to use a deep
understanding of human psychology to negotiate a lower
car price, a bigger raise, and a child’s bedtime. This book
will teach you to reclaim control of the conversations that
inform your life and career. The first step to achieving a mastery of daily negotiation
is to get over your aversion to negotiating. You don’t need
to like it; you just need to understand that’s how the world
works. Negotiating does not mean browbeating or grinding
someone down. It simply means playing the emotional
game that human society is set up for.",
3553,Never split the difference,"In this world, you get
what you ask for; you just have to ask correctly. So claim
your prerogative to ask for what you think is right. What this book is really about, then, is getting you to
accept negotiation and in doing so learn how to get what
you want in a psychologically aware way. You’ll learn to
use your emotions, instincts, and insights in any encounter
to connect better with others, influence them, and achieve
more. Effective negotiation is applied people smarts, a
psychological edge in every domain of life: how to size
someone up, how to influence their sizing up of you, and
how to use that knowledge to get what you want. But beware: this is not another pop-psych book. It’s a
deep and thoughtful (and most of all, practical) take on
leading psychological theory that distills lessons from a
twenty-four-year career in the FBI and ten years teaching
and consulting in the best business schools and corporations
in the world.",
3554,Never split the difference,"And it works for one simple reason: it was designed in
and for the real world. It was not born in a classroom or a
training hall, but built from years of experience that
improved it until it reached near perfection. Remember, a hostage negotiator plays a unique role: he
has to win. Can he say to a bank robber, “Okay, you’ve
taken four hostages. Let’s split the difference—give me two,
and we’ll call it a day?”
No. A successful hostage negotiator has to get
everything he asks for, without giving anything back of
substance, and do so in a way that leaves the adversaries
feeling as if they have a great relationship. His work is
emotional intelligence on steroids. Those are the tools you’ll
learn here. THE BOOK
Like a contractor building a house, this book is constructed
from the ground up: first comes the big slabs of foundation,
then the necessary load-bearing walls, the elegant but
impermeable roof, and the lovely interior decorations. Each chapter expands on the previous one.",
3555,Never split the difference,"First you’ll
learn the refined techniques of this approach to Active
Listening and then you’ll move on to specific tools, turns of
phrase, the ins and outs of the final act—haggling—and,
finally, how to discover the rarity that can help you achieve
true negotiating greatness: the Black Swan. In Chapter 2, you’ll learn how to avoid the assumptions
that blind neophyte negotiators and replace them with Active
Listening techniques like Mirroring, Silences, and the Late-
Night FM DJ Voice. You’ll discover how to slow things
down and make your counterpart feel safe enough to reveal
themselves; to discern between wants (aspirations) and
needs (the bare minimum for a deal); and to laser-focus on
what the other party has to say. Chapter 3 will delve into Tactical Empathy. You’ll learn
how to recognize your counterpart’s perspective and then
gain trust and understanding through Labeling—that is, by
repeating that perspective back to them.",
3556,Never split the difference,"You’ll also learn
how to defuse negative dynamics by bringing them into the
open. Finally, I’ll explain how to disarm your counterpart’s
complaints about you by speaking them aloud in an
Accusation Audit. Next, in Chapter 4, I’ll examine ways to make your
counterpart feel understood and positively affirmed in a
negotiation 
in 
order 
to 
create an 
atmosphere 
of
unconditional positive regard. Here, you’ll learn why you
should strive for “That’s right” instead of “Yes” at every
stage of a negotiation, and how to identify, rearticulate, and
emotionally affirm your counterpart’s worldview with
Summaries and Paraphrasing. Chapter 5 teaches the flip side of Getting to Yes. You’ll
learn why it’s vitally important to get to “No” because “No”
starts the negotiation. You’ll also discover how to step out
of your ego and negotiate in your counterpart’s world, the
only way to achieve an agreement the other side will
implement.",
3557,Never split the difference,"Finally, you’ll see how to engage your
counterpart by acknowledging their right to choose, and
you’ll learn an email technique that ensures that you’ll never
be ignored again. In Chapter 6, you’ll discover the art of bending reality. That is, I’ll explain a variety of tools for framing a
negotiation in such a way that your counterpart will
unconsciously accept the limits you place on the discussion. You’ll learn how to navigate deadlines to create urgency;
employ the idea of fairness to nudge your counterpart; and
anchor their emotions so that not accepting your offer feels
like a loss. After this, Chapter 7 is dedicated to that incredibly
powerful tool I used at Harvard: Calibrated Questions, the
queries that begin with “How?” or “What?” By eliminating
“Yes” and “No” answers they force your counterpart to
apply their mental energy to solving your problems. In Chapter 8 I demonstrate how to employ these
Calibrated Questions to guard against failures in the
implementation phase.",
3558,Never split the difference,"“Yes,” as I always say, is nothing
without “How?” You’ll also discover the importance of
nonverbal communication; how to use “How” questions to
gently say “No”; how to get your counterparts to bid against
themselves; and how to influence the deal killers when
they’re not at the table. At a certain point, every negotiation gets down to the
brass tacks: that is, to old-school haggling. Chapter 9 offers
a step-by-step process for effective bargaining, from how to
prepare to how to dodge an aggressive counterpart and how
to go on the offensive. You’ll learn the Ackerman system,
the most effective process the FBI has for setting and
making offers. Finally, Chapter 10 explains how to find and use those
most rare of negotiation animals: the Black Swan. In every
negotiation there are between three and five pieces of
information that, were they to be uncovered, would change
everything. The concept is an absolute game-changer; so
much so, I’ve named my company The Black Swan Group.",
3559,Never split the difference,"In this chapter, you’ll learn how to recognize the markers
that show the Black Swan’s hidden nest, as well as simple
tools for employing Black Swans to gain leverage over your
counterpart and achieve truly amazing deals. Each chapter will start with a fast-paced story of a
hostage negotiation, which will then be dissected with an
eye to explaining what worked and what didn’t. After I
explain the theory and the tools, you’ll read real-life case
studies from me and others who’ve used these tools to
prevail while negotiating a salary, purchasing a car, or
working out nettlesome problems at home. When you finish this book, I will have succeeded if
you’ve applied these crucial techniques to improve your
career and life. I’m sure you will. Just remember, to
successfully negotiate it is critical to prepare.",
3560,Never split the difference,"Which is why
in the Appendix you’ll find an invaluable tool I use with all
my students and clients called the Negotiation One Sheet: a
concise primer of nearly all our tactics and strategies for you
to think through and customize for whatever kind of deal
you’re looking to close. Most important to me is that you understand how urgent,
essential, and even beautiful negotiation can be. When we
embrace negotiating’s transformative possibilities, we learn
how to get what we want and how to move others to a better
place. Negotiation is the heart of collaboration. It is what makes
conflict potentially meaningful and productive for all
parties. It can change your life, as it has changed mine. I’ve always thought of myself as just a regular guy. Hardworking and willing to learn, yes, but not particularly
talented. And I’ve always felt that life holds amazing
possibilities. In my much younger days, I just didn’t know
how to unlock those possibilities.",
3561,Never split the difference,"But with the skills I’ve learned, I’ve found myself doing
extraordinary things and watching the people I’ve taught
achieve truly life-changing results. When I use what I’ve
learned over the last thirty years, I know I actually have the
power to change the course of where my life is going, and
to help others do that as well. Thirty years ago, while I felt
like that could be done, I didn’t know how. Now I do. Here’s how. CHAPTER 2
BE A MIRROR
September 30, 1993
A brisk autumn morning, around eight thirty. Two masked
bank robbers trigger an alarm as they storm into the Chase
Manhattan Bank at Seventh Avenue and Carroll Street in
Brooklyn. There are only two female tellers and a male
security guard inside. The robbers crack the unarmed sixty-
year-old security guard across the skull with a .357, drag
him to the men’s room, and lock him inside. One of the
tellers gets the same pistol-whipping treatment.",
3562,Never split the difference,"Then one of the robbers turns to the other teller, puts the
barrel in her mouth, and pulls the trigger—click, goes the
empty chamber. “Next one is real,” says the robber. “Now open the
vault.”
A bank robbery, with hostages. Happens all the time in the
movies, but it had been almost twenty years since there’d
been one of these standoffs in New York, the city with more
hostage negotiation jobs than any other jurisdiction in the
country. And this happened to be my very first feet-to-the-fire, in-
your-face hostage job. I had been training for about a year and a half in hostage
negotiations, but I hadn’t had a chance to use my new skills. For me, 1993 had already been a very busy and incredible
ride. Working on the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force, I
had been the co–case agent in an investigation that thwarted
a plot to set off bombs in the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels,
the United Nations, and 26 Federal Plaza, the home of the
FBI in New York City.",
3563,Never split the difference,"We broke it up just as terrorists were
mixing bombs in a safe house. The plotters were associated
with an Egyptian cell that had ties to the “Blind Sheikh,”
who later would be found guilty of masterminding the plot
that we uncovered. You might think a bank robbery would be small potatoes
after we busted up a terrorist plot, but by then I had already
come to realize that negotiation would be my lifelong
passion. I was eager to put my new skills to the test. And
besides, there was nothing small about this situation. When we got the call, my colleague Charlie Beaudoin
and I raced to the scene, bailed out of his black Crown
Victoria, and made our way to the command post. The
whole cavalry showed up for this one—NYPD, FBI, SWAT
—all the muscle and savvy of law enforcement up against
the knee-jerk desperation of a couple of bank robbers
seemingly in over their heads. New York police, behind a wall of blue and white trucks
and patrol cars, had set up across the street inside another
bank.",
3564,Never split the difference,"SWAT team members, peering through rifle scopes
from the roofs of nearby brownstone buildings, had their
weapons trained on the bank’s front and rear doors. ASSUMPTIONS BLIND, HYPOTHESES GUIDE
Good negotiators, going in, know they have to be ready for
possible surprises; great negotiators aim to use their skills to
reveal the surprises they are certain exist. Experience will have taught them that they are best
served by holding multiple hypotheses—about the situation,
about the counterpart’s wants, about a whole array of
variables—in their mind at the same time. Present and alert
in the moment, they use all the new information that comes
their way to test and winnow true hypotheses from false
ones. In negotiation, each new psychological insight or
additional piece of information revealed heralds a step
forward and allows one to discard one hypothesis in favor
of another. You should engage the process with a mindset
of discovery.",
3565,Never split the difference,"Your goal at the outset is to extract and
observe as much information as possible. Which, by the
way, is one of the reasons that really smart people often
have trouble being negotiators—they’re so smart they think
they don’t have anything to discover. Too often people find it easier just to stick with what
they believe. Using what they’ve heard or their own biases,
they often make assumptions about others even before
meeting them. They even ignore their own perceptions to
make them conform to foregone conclusions. These
assumptions muck up our perceptual windows onto the
world, showing us an unchanging—often flawed—version
of the situation. Great negotiators are able to question the assumptions
that the rest of the involved players accept on faith or in
arrogance, and thus remain more emotionally open to all
possibilities, and more intellectually agile to a fluid situation. Unfortunately, back in 1993, I was far from great. Everyone thought the crisis would be over quickly.",
3566,Never split the difference,"The
bank robbers had little choice but to surrender—or so we
thought. We actually started the day with intelligence that
the bank robbers wanted to surrender. Little did we know
that was a ruse their ringleader planted to buy time. And
throughout the day, he constantly referred to the influence
the other four bank robbers exerted on him. I hadn’t yet
learned to be aware of a counterpart’s overuse of personal
pronouns—we/they o r me/I. The less important he makes
himself, the more important he probably is (and vice versa). We would later find out there was only one other bank
robber, and he had been tricked into the robbery. Actually,
three robbers, if you counted the getaway driver, who got
away before we even entered the scene. The “lead” hostage-taker was running his own
“counterintelligence operation,” feeding us all kinds of
misinformation. He wanted us to think he had a bunch of
co-conspirators with him—from a number of different
countries.",
3567,Never split the difference,"He also wanted us to think that his partners were
much more volatile and dangerous than he was. Looking back, of course, his game plan was clear—he
wanted to confuse us as much as he could until he could
figure a way out. He would constantly tell us that he wasn’t
in charge and that every decision was the responsibility of
the other guys. He would indicate that he was scared—or, at
least, a little tentative—when we asked him to pass along
certain information. And yet he always spoke with a voice
of complete calm and absolute confidence. It was a
reminder to my colleagues and me that until you know what
you’re dealing with, you don’t know what you’re dealing
with. Though the call had come in about 8:30 a.m., by the
time we arrived across the street from the bank and made
contact it was probably about 10:30 a.m. The word when we
came on the scene was that this was going to be cookie-
cutter, by the book, short and sweet.",
3568,Never split the difference,"Our commanders
thought we’d be in and out of there in ten minutes, because
the bad guys supposedly wanted to give themselves up. This
would later become a problem, when negotiations stalled
and Command became embarrassed, because they’d made
the mistake of sharing this early optimism with the press,
based on all the early misinformation. We arrived on the scene to take a surrender, but the
situation went sideways almost immediately. Everything we assumed we knew was wrong. CALM THE SCHIZOPHRENIC
Our Negotiation Operation Center (NOC) was set up in an
office in a bank immediately across a narrow street from the
Chase branch. We were way too close to the hostage site, so
right away we were at a disadvantage. We were less than
thirty yards from the crisis point, where ideally you want to
have a little more of a buffer than that. You want to put
some distance between you and whatever worst-case
scenario might be waiting at the other end of the deal.",
3569,Never split the difference,"When my partner and I arrived, I was immediately
assigned to coach the police department negotiator on the
phone. His name was Joe, and he was doing fine—but in
these types of situations, nobody worked alone. We always
worked in teams. The thinking behind this policy was that
all these extra sets of ears would pick up extra information. In some standoffs, we had as many as five people on the
line, analyzing the information as it came in, offering
behind-the-scenes input and guidance to our man on the
phone—and that’s how we were set up here. We had Joe
taking the lead on the phone, and another three or four of us
were listening in, passing notes back and forth, trying to
make sense of a confusing situation. One of us was trying to
gauge the mood of the bad guy taking the lead on the other
end, and another was listening in for clues or “tells” that
might give us a better read on what we were facing, and so
on.",
3570,Never split the difference,"Students of mine balk at this notion, asking, “Seriously,
do you really need a whole team to . . . hear someone out?”
The fact that the FBI has come to that conclusion, I tell
them, should be a wake-up call. It’s really not that easy to
listen well. We are easily distracted. We engage in selective
listening, hearing only what we want to hear, our minds
acting on a cognitive bias for consistency rather than truth. And that’s just the start. Most people approach a negotiation so preoccupied by
the arguments that support their position that they are unable
to listen attentively. In one of the most cited research papers
in psychology,1 George A. Miller persuasively put forth the
idea that we can process only about seven pieces of
information in our conscious mind at any given moment. In
other words, we are easily overwhelmed. For those people who view negotiation as a battle of
arguments, it’s the voices in their own head that are
overwhelming them.",
3571,Never split the difference,"When they’re not talking, they’re
thinking about their arguments, and when they are talking,
they’re making their arguments. Often those on both sides
of the table are doing the same thing, so you have what I
call a state of schizophrenia: everyone just listening to the
voice in their head (and not well, because they’re doing
seven or eight other things at the same time). It may look
like there are only two people in a conversation, but really
it’s more like four people all talking at once. There’s one powerful way to quiet the voice in your
head and the voice in their head at the same time: treat two
schizophrenics with just one pill. Instead of prioritizing your
argument—in fact, instead of doing any thinking at all in the
early goings about what you’re going to say—make your
sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what
they have to say. In that mode of true active listening—
aided by the tactics you’ll learn in the following chapters—
you’ll disarm your counterpart.",
3572,Never split the difference,"You’ll make them feel safe. The voice in their head will begin to quiet down. The goal is to identify what your counterparts actually
need (monetarily, emotionally, or otherwise) and get them
feeling safe enough to talk and talk and talk some more
about what they want. The latter will help you discover the
former. Wants are easy to talk about, representing the
aspiration of getting our way, and sustaining any illusion of
control we have as we begin to negotiate; needs imply
survival, the very minimum required to make us act, and so
make us vulnerable. But neither wants nor needs are where
we start; it begins with listening, making it about the other
people, validating their emotions, and creating enough trust
and safety for a real conversation to begin. We were far from that goal with the lead hostage-taker
on the call. He kept putting up these weird smoke screens.",
3573,Never split the difference,"He wouldn’t give up his name, he tried to disguise his voice,
he was always telling Joe he was being put on speaker so
everyone around him in the bank could hear, and then he
would abruptly announce that he was putting Joe on “hold”
and hang up the phone. He was constantly asking about a
van, saying he and his partners wanted us to arrange one for
them so they could drive themselves and the hostages to the
local precinct to surrender. That was where the surrender
nonsense had come from—but, of course, this wasn’t a
surrender plan so much as it was an escape plan. In the back
of his mind, this guy thought he could somehow leave the
bank without being taken into custody, and now that his
getaway driver had fled the scene he needed access to a
vehicle. After it was all over, a couple of other details came clear. We weren’t the only ones who had been lied to. Apparently,
this lead bank robber hadn’t told his partners they were
going to rob a bank that morning.",
3574,Never split the difference,"It turned out he was a
cash courier who serviced the bank, and his partners were
under the impression that they were going to burglarize the
ATM. They didn’t sign up for taking hostages, so we
learned that this guy’s co-conspirators were also hostages, in
a way. They were caught up in a bad situation they didn’t
see coming—and, in the end, it was this “disconnect”
among the hostage-takers that helped us to drive a wedge
between them and put an end to the stalemate. SLOW. IT. DOWN. The leader wanted to make us think he and his partners were
taking good care of his hostages, but in reality the security
guard was out of the picture and the second bank teller had
run to the bank basement to hide.",
3575,Never split the difference,"Whenever Joe said he
wanted to talk to the hostages, the hostage-taker would stall,
and make it seem like there was this frenzy of activity going
on inside the bank, going to ridiculous lengths to tell us how
much time and energy he and his cohorts were spending on
taking good care of the hostages. Very often, the leader
would use this as a reason to put Joe on hold, or to end a
call. He’d say, “The girls need to go to the bathroom.” Or,
“The girls want to call their families.” Or, “The girls want to
get something to eat.”
Joe was doing a good job keeping this guy talking, but
he was slightly limited by the negotiating approach that
police departments were using at the time. The approach
was half MSU—Making Shit Up—and half a sort of sales
approach—basically 
trying 
to 
persuade, 
coerce, 
or
manipulate in any way possible. The problem was, we were
in too much of a hurry, driving too hard toward a quick
solution; trying to be a problem solver, not a people mover.",
3576,Never split the difference,"Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are
prone to making. If we’re too much in a hurry, people can
feel as if they’re not being heard and we risk undermining
the rapport and trust we’ve built. There’s plenty of research
that now validates the passage of time as one of the most
important tools for a negotiator. When you slow the process
down, you also calm it down. After all, if someone is
talking, they’re not shooting. We caught a break when the robbers started to make
noise about food. Joe was going back and forth with them
for a while on what they were going to have and how we
were going to get it to them. It became a negotiation in and
of itself. We got it all set up, prepared to send the food in on
a kind of robot device, because that’s what this guy was
comfortable with, but then he did an about-face, said to
forget about it. Said they’d found some food inside, so it
was just one brick wall after another, one smoke screen after
another.",
3577,Never split the difference,"It would feel to us like we were making a little
progress, then this guy would take an abrupt turn, or hang
up on us, or change his mind. Meanwhile, our investigators used the time to run the
registration of every one of the dozens of vehicles found
nearby on the street, and managed to speak to the owners of
every one of them except one—a car belonging to someone
named Chris Watts. This became our one and only lead, at
the time, and as our endless back-and-forth continued on the
phone we sent a group of investigators to the address on
Chris Watts’s registration, where they found someone who
knew Chris Watts and agreed to come down to the scene of
the standoff to possibly identify him. We still didn’t have a visual on the inside, so our
eyewitness had to be more of an “earwitness”—and he was
able to identify Chris Watts by his voice. We now knew more about our adversary than he thought
we knew, which put us at a momentary advantage.",
3578,Never split the difference,"We were
putting together all the puzzle pieces, but it didn’t get us any
closer to our endgame, which was to determine for sure who
was inside the building, to ensure the health and well-being
of the hostages, and to get them all out safely—the good
guys and the bad guys. THE VOICE
After five hours, we were stuck, so the lieutenant in charge
asked me to take over. Joe was out; I was in. Basically, it
was the only strategic play at our disposal that didn’t
involve an escalation in force. The man we now knew as Chris Watts had been in the
habit of ending his calls abruptly, so my job was to find a
way to keep him talking. I switched into my Late-Night, FM
DJ Voice: deep, soft, slow, and reassuring. I had been
instructed to confront Watts as soon as possible about his
identity. I also came onto the phone with no warning,
replacing Joe, against standard protocol. It was a shrewd
move by the NYPD lieutenant to shake things up, but it
easily could have backfired.",
3579,Never split the difference,"This soothing voice was the
key to easing the confrontation. Chris Watts heard my voice on the line and cut me off
immediately—said, “Hey, what happened to Joe?”
I said, “Joe’s gone. This is Chris. You’re talking to me
now.”
I didn’t put it like a question. I made a downward-
inflecting statement, in a downward-inflecting tone of voice. The best way to describe the late-night FM DJ’s voice is as
the voice of calm and reason. When deliberating on a negotiating strategy or approach,
people tend to focus all their energies on what to say or do,
but it’s how we are (our general demeanor and delivery)
that is both the easiest thing to enact and the most
immediately effective mode of influence. Our brains don’t
just process and understand the actions and words of others
but their feelings and intentions too, the social meaning of
their behavior and their emotions.",
3580,Never split the difference,"On a mostly unconscious
level, we can understand the minds of others not through
any kind of thinking but through quite literally grasping
what the other is feeling. Think of it as a kind of involuntary neurological
telepathy—each of us in every given moment signaling to
the world around us whether we are ready to play or fight,
laugh or cry. When we radiate warmth and acceptance, conversations
just seem to flow. When we enter a room with a level of
comfort and enthusiasm, we attract people toward us. Smile
at someone on the street, and as a reflex they’ll smile back. Understanding that reflex and putting it into practice is
critical to the success of just about every negotiating skill
there is to learn. That’s why your most powerful tool in any verbal
communication is your voice. You can use your voice to
intentionally reach into someone’s brain and flip an
emotional switch. Distrusting to trusting. Nervous to calm.",
3581,Never split the difference,"In an instant, the switch will flip just like that with the right
delivery. There are essentially three voice tones available to
negotiators: the late-night FM DJ voice, the positive/playful
voice, and the direct or assertive voice. Forget the assertive
voice for now; except in very rare circumstances, using it is
like slapping yourself in the face while you’re trying to
make progress. You’re signaling dominance onto your
counterpart, who will either aggressively, or passive-
aggressively, push back against attempts to be controlled. Most 
of 
the 
time, 
you 
should 
be 
using 
the
positive/playful voice. It’s the voice of an easygoing, good-
natured person. Your attitude is light and encouraging. The
key here is to relax and smile while you’re talking. A smile,
even while talking on the phone, has an impact tonally that
the other person will pick up on. The effect these voices have are cross-cultural and never
lost in translation.",
3582,Never split the difference,"On a vacation to Turkey with his
girlfriend, one of our instructors at The Black Swan Group
was befuddled—not to mention a little embarrassed—that
his partner was repeatedly getting better deals in their
backstreet haggling sessions at the spice markets in Istanbul. For the merchants in such markets throughout the Middle
East, bargaining is an art form. Their emotional intelligence
is finely honed, and they’ll use hospitality and friendliness
in a powerful way to draw you in and create reciprocity that
ends in an exchange of money. But it works both ways, as
our instructor discovered while observing his girlfriend in
action: she approached each encounter as a fun game, so
that no matter how aggressively she pushed, her smile and
playful demeanor primed her merchant friends to settle on a
successful outcome. When people are in a positive frame of mind, they think
more quickly, and are more likely to collaborate and
problem-solve (instead of fight and resist).",
3583,Never split the difference,"It applies to the
smile-er as much as to the smile-ee: a smile on your face,
and in your voice, will increase your own mental agility. Playful wasn’t the move with Chris Watts. The way the
late-night FM DJ voice works is that, when you inflect your
voice in a downward way, you put it out there that you’ve
got it covered. Talking slowly and clearly you convey one
idea: I’m in control. When you inflect in an upward way,
you invite a response. Why? Because you’ve brought in a
measure of uncertainty. You’ve made a statement sound like
a question. You’ve left the door open for the other guy to
take the lead, so I was careful here to be quiet, self-assured. It’s the same voice I might use in a contract negotiation,
when an item isn’t up for discussion. If I see a work-for-hire
clause, for example, I might say, “We don’t do work-for-
hire.” Just like that, plain, simple, and friendly.",
3584,Never split the difference,"I don’t offer
up an alternative, because it would beg further discussion,
so I just make a straightforward declaration. That’s how I played it here. I said, “Joe’s gone. You’re
talking to me now.”
Done deal. You can be very direct and to the point as long as you
create safety by a tone of voice that says I’m okay, you’re
okay, let’s figure things out. The tide was turning. Chris Watts was rattled, but he had a
few moves left in him. One of the bad guys went down to
the basement and collected one of the female bank tellers. She’d disappeared into the bowels of the bank at some
point, but Chris Watts and his accomplice hadn’t chased
after her because they knew she wasn’t going anywhere. Now one of the bank robbers dragged her back upstairs and
put her on the phone. She said, “I’m okay.” That’s all. I said, “Who is this?”
She said, “I’m okay.”
I wanted to keep her talking, so I asked her name—but
then, just like that, she was gone. This was a brilliant move on Chris Watts’s part.",
3585,Never split the difference,"It was a
threat, teasing us with the woman’s voice, but subtly and
indirectly. It was a way for the bad guy to let us know he
was calling the shots on his end of the phone without
directly escalating the situation. He’d given us a “proof of
life,” confirming that he did indeed have hostages with him
who were in decent enough shape to talk on the phone, but
stopped short of allowing us to gather any useful
information. He’d managed to take back a measure of control. MIRRORING
Chris Watts came back on the phone trying to act like
nothing had happened. He was a little rattled, that’s for sure,
but now he was talking. “We’ve identified every car on the street and talked to all
the owners except one,” I said to Watts. “We’ve got a van
out here, a blue and gray van. We’ve been able to get a
handle on the owners of all of the vehicles except this one in
particular. Do you know anything about it?”
“The other vehicle’s not out there because you guys
chased my driver away . . .” he blurted.",
3586,Never split the difference,"“We chased your driver away?” I mirrored. “Well, when he seen the police he cut.”
“We don’t know anything about this guy; is he the one
who was driving the van?” I asked. The mirroring continued between me and Watts, and he
made a series of damaging admissions. He started vomiting
information, as we now refer to it in my consulting business. He talked about an accomplice we had no knowledge of at
the time. That exchange helped us nail the driver of the
getaway car. Mirroring, also called isopraxism, is essentially imitation. It’s another neurobehavior humans (and other animals)
display in which we copy each other to comfort each other. It can be done with speech patterns, body language,
vocabulary, tempo, and tone of voice. It’s generally an
unconscious behavior—we are rarely aware of it when it’s
happening—but it’s a sign that people are bonding, in sync,
and establishing the kind of rapport that leads to trust.",
3587,Never split the difference,"It’s a phenomenon (and now technique) that follows a
very basic but profound biological principle: We fear what’s
different and are drawn to what’s similar. As the saying
goes, birds of a feather flock together. Mirroring, then, when
practiced consciously, is the art of insinuating similarity. “Trust me,” a mirror signals to another’s unconscious, “You
and I—we’re alike.”
Once you’re attuned to the dynamic, you’ll see it
everywhere: couples walking on the street with their steps in
perfect synchrony; friends in conversation at a park, both
nodding their heads and crossing the legs at about the same
time. These people are, in a word, connected. While mirroring is most often associated with forms of
nonverbal communication, especially body language, as
negotiators a “mirror” focuses on the words and nothing
else. Not the body language. Not the accent. Not the tone or
delivery. Just the words.",
3588,Never split the difference,"It’s almost laughably simple: for the FBI, a “mirror” is
when you repeat the last three words (or the critical one to
three words) of what someone has just said. Of the entirety
of the FBI’s hostage negotiation skill set, mirroring is the
closest one gets to a Jedi mind trick. Simple, and yet
uncannily effective. By repeating back what people say, you trigger this
mirroring instinct and your counterpart will inevitably
elaborate on what was just said and sustain the process of
connecting. Psychologist Richard Wiseman created a study
using waiters to identify what was the more effective
method of creating a connection with strangers: mirroring or
positive reinforcement. One group of waiters, using positive reinforcement,
lavished praise and encouragement on patrons using words
such as “great,” “no problem,” and “sure” in response to
each order. The other group of waiters mirrored their
customers simply by repeating their orders back to them.",
3589,Never split the difference,"The results were stunning: the average tip of the waiters who
mirrored was 70 percent more than of those who used
positive reinforcement. I decided it was time to hit him with his name—to let him
know we were on to him. I said, “There’s a vehicle out here,
and it’s registered to a Chris Watts.”
He said, “Okay.” Not letting anything on. I said, “Is he there? Is this you? Are you Chris Watts?”
It was a stupid question, on my part. A mistake. For a
mirror to be effective, you’ve got to let it sit there and do its
work. It needs a bit of silence. I stepped all over my mirror. As soon as I said it, I wanted to take it back. “Are you Chris Watts?”
What the hell could this guy say to that? Of course, he
replied, “No.”
I’d made a bone-headed move and given Chris Watts a
way to dodge this confrontation, but he was nevertheless
rattled. Up until this moment, he’d thought he was
anonymous. Whatever fantasy he had running through his
head, there was a way out for him, a do-over button.",
3590,Never split the difference,"Now
he knew different. I composed myself, slowed it down a
little, and this time shut my mouth after the mirror—I said,
“No? You said ‘okay.’”
Now I had him, I thought. His voice went way up. He
ended up blurting a few things out, vomiting more
information, and became so flustered he stopped talking to
me. Suddenly his accomplice, who we later learned was
Bobby Goodwin, came onto the phone. We hadn’t heard from this second hostage-taker, until
now. We’d known all along that Chris Watts wasn’t acting
alone, but we hadn’t gotten a good read on how many
people he had working with him on this, and now here was
his unwitting accomplice, thinking our original police
department negotiator was still handling our end. We knew
this because he kept calling me “Joe,” which told us he’d
been in the loop early on, and somewhat less involved as
the stalemate dragged on. At the very least, the disconnect told me these guys
weren’t exactly on the same page—but I didn’t jump to
correct him.",
3591,Never split the difference,"Another thing: it sounded like this second guy was
speaking through a towel, or a sweatshirt—like he was
biting on some kind of fabric, even. Going to all these
lengths to mask his voice, which meant he was clearly
scared. He was nervous, jumpy as hell, anxious over how
this standoff was going down. I tried to set him at ease—still with the downward-
inflecting DJ voice. I said, “Nobody’s going anywhere.” I
said, “Nobody’s gonna get hurt.”
After about a minute and a half, the jumpiness seemed to
disappear. The muffled voice, too. His voice came through
much more clearly as he said, “I trust you, Joe.”
The more I kept this second guy on the phone, the more
it became clear he was someplace he did not want to be. Bobby wanted out—and, of course, he wanted out without
getting hurt. He was already in deep, but he didn’t want it to
get any deeper.",
3592,Never split the difference,"He didn’t start out that day planning to rob a
bank, but it took hearing my calm voice on the other end of
the phone for him to start to see a way out. The seventh-
largest standing army in the world was at the ready outside
the bank doors—that’s the size and scope of the NYPD, in
full force, and their guns were fixed on him and his partner. Obviously, Bobby was desperate to step out those doors
unharmed. I didn’t know where Bobby was, inside the bank. To this
day, I don’t know if he managed to step away from his
partner, or if he was talking to me in plain sight of Chris
Watts. I only know that I had his full attention, and that he
was looking for a way to end the standoff—or, at least, to
end his role in it. I learned later that in between phone calls Chris Watts
was busy squirreling cash inside the bank walls. He was also
burning piles of cash, in full view of the two female
hostages.",
3593,Never split the difference,"On the face of it, this was bizarre behavior, but to
a guy like Chris Watts there was a certain logic to it. Apparently, he’d gotten it in his head that he could burn,
say, $50,000, and if $300,000 was reported missing bank
officials wouldn’t think to go looking for the other
$250,000. It was an interesting deception—not exactly
clever, but interesting. It showed a weird attention to detail. In his own mind at least, if Chris Watts managed to escape
this box he’d made for himself, he could lie low for a while
and come back at some future date for the money he’d
stashed away—money that would no longer be on the
bank’s ledgers. What I liked about this second guy, Bobby, was that he
didn’t try to play any games with me on the phone. He was
a straight shooter, so I was able to respond as a straight
shooter in kind. The same way I’d get back whatever I put
out, he was getting back whatever he was putting out, so I
was with him on this.",
3594,Never split the difference,"Experience told me all I had to do was
keep him talking and he’d come around. We’d find a way to
get him out of that bank—with or without Chris Watts. Someone on my team handed me a note: “Ask him if he
wants to come out.”
I said, “Do you want to come out first?”
I paused, remaining silent. “I don’t know how I’d do it,” Bobby said finally. “What’s stopping you from doing it right now?” I asked. “How do I do that?” he asked again. “Tell you what. Meet me out front right now.”
This was a breakthrough moment for us—but we still
had to get Bobby out of there, and find a way to let him
know that I’d be waiting for him on the other side of the
door. I’d given him my word that I would be the one to take
his surrender, and that he wouldn’t get hurt, and now we
had to make that happen—and very often it’s this
implementation phase that can be the most difficult. Our team scrambled to put a plan in place to bring this
about. I started putting on bulletproof gear.",
3595,Never split the difference,"We surveyed the
scene, figuring I could position myself behind one of the big
trucks we’d parked out in front of the bank, to give me a
measure of cover, just in case. Then we ran into one of those maddening situations
where one hand didn’t know what the other was doing. It
turned out the bank door had been barricaded from the
outside early on in the standoff—a precaution to ensure that
none of the bank robbers could flee the scene. We all knew
this, of course, on some level, but when the time came for
Bobby to give himself up and walk out the door, it’s like our
brains went into sleep mode. No one on the SWAT team
thought to remind anyone on the negotiating team of this
one significant detail, so for a couple long beats Bobby
couldn’t get out, and I got a sick feeling in my stomach that
whatever progress we’d just made with this guy would be
for nothing. So there we were, scrambling to recover.",
3596,Never split the difference,"Soon, two
SWAT guys moved forward toward the entrance, with
ballistic shields, guns drawn, to take the locks and the
barricade off the door—and at this point they still didn’t
know what they were facing on the other side. It was a
super-tense moment. There could have been a dozen guns
on these two SWAT guys, but there was nothing for them to
do but make their slow approach. Those guys were rock
solid. They unlocked the door, backed away, and finally we
were good to go. Bobby came out—his hands in the air. I’d walked him
through a specific set of instructions on what to do when he
came out the door, what to expect. A couple of SWAT guys
patted him down. Bobby turned and looked and said,
“Where’s Chris? Take me to Chris.”
Finally, they brought him around to me, and we were
able to debrief him inside our makeshift command post. This was the first we learned that there was only one other
hostage-taker inside—and this naturally set the commander
off.",
3597,Never split the difference,"I didn’t learn this until later, but I could see why he
would have been angry and embarrassed at this latest turn. All along, he’d been telling the media there were a bunch of
bad guys inside—an international assemblage of bad guys,
remember? But now that it turned out it was essentially a
two-man operation, and one of the bad guys had wanted no
part of it, the commander looked like he didn’t have a
handle on the situation. But like I said, we didn’t know about the commander’s
reaction just yet. All we knew was that we’d just gotten all
this new intel, which told us we were closer to achieving our
desired outcome than we had just thought. This was a
positive development, something to celebrate. With what we
now knew, it was going to be a whole lot easier to negotiate
our way through the rest of it, and yet this commander was
angry.",
3598,Never split the difference,"He didn’t like that he’d been played, so he turned to
one of the guys from NYPD’s Technical Assistance
Response Unit (TARU) and commanded them to get a
camera inside the bank, a mic . . . something. Now that I was huddled with Bobby, the commander
swapped me out in favor of another primary negotiator on
the phone. The new negotiator played it the same way I had,
a couple of hours earlier—said, “This is Dominick. You’re
talking to me now.”
Dominick Misino was a great hostage negotiator—in my
view, one of the world’s great closers, which was the term
often used for the guy brought in to bang out the last details
and secure the deal. He didn’t get rattled and he was good at
what he did. Matter-of-fact. Street smart. Dominick plowed ahead. And then, an amazing thing
happened—a nearly disastrous amazing thing. As Chris
Watts was talking to Dominick, he heard an electric tool of
some kind burrowing its way through the wall behind him.",
3599,Never split the difference,"It was one of our TARU guys, trying to get a bug planted
inside—in precisely the wrong spot, at precisely the wrong
time. Chris Watts was already rattled enough as it was, his
partner giving himself up like that and leaving him to play
out the siege on his own. And now, to hear our guys drilling
through the wall, it just about set him off. He responded like a pit bull backed into a corner. He
called Dominick a liar. Dominick was unflappable. He kept
his cool as Chris Watts raged on the other end of the phone,
and eventually Dominick’s cool, calm demeanor brought
the guy from a boil to a simmer. In retrospect, it was a fool move to try to get a bug inside
the bank at this late stage—born out of frustration and panic. We’d gotten one of the hostage-takers out of the bank, but
now we’d given back a measure of control. Startling the one
remaining hostage-taker, who may or may not have been a
loose cannon, was absolutely not a good idea.",
3600,Never split the difference,"As Dominick went to work smoothing over the situation,
Chris Watts switched things up on us. He said, “What if I let
a hostage go?”
This came as if from nowhere. Dominick hadn’t even
thought to ask, but Chris Watts just offered up one of the
tellers like it was no big deal—and to him, at this late stage
in the standoff, I guess it wasn’t. From his view, such a
conciliatory move might buy him enough time to figure out
a way to escape. Dominick remained calm, but seized on the opportunity. He said he wanted to talk to the hostage first, to make sure
everything went okay, so Chris Watts tapped one of the
women and put her on the phone. The woman had been
paying attention, knew there’d been some sort of snafu
when Bobby wanted to give himself up, so even though she
was still completely terrified she had the presence of mind to
ask about the door. I remember thinking this showed a lot of
brass—to be terrified, held against your will, roughed up a
bit, and to still have your wits about you.",
3601,Never split the difference,"She said, “Are you sure you have a key to the front
door?”
Dominick said, “The front door’s open.”
And it was. Ultimately, what happened was one of the women came
out, unharmed, and an hour or so later the other woman
followed, also unharmed. We were working on getting the bank guard out, but we
couldn’t be sure from the accounts of these bank tellers
what kind of shape this guy might be in. We didn’t even
know if he was still alive. They hadn’t seen him since first
thing that morning. He could have had a heart attack and
died—there was just no way to know. But Chris Watts had one last trick up his sleeve. He
pulled a fast one on us and out of the blue, offered to come
out. Maybe he thought he could catch us off guard one last
time. What was strange about his sudden appearance was
that he seemed to be looking about, surveying the scene,
like he still thought he’d somehow elude capture.",
3602,Never split the difference,"Right up
until the moment the cops put the handcuffs on him, his
gaze was darting back and forth, scanning for some kind of
opportunity. The bright lights were on this guy, he was
basically surrounded, but somewhere in the back of his
scheming, racing mind he still thought he had a chance. It was a long, long day, but it went down in the books as
a success. Nobody was hurt. The bad guys were in custody. And I emerged from the experience humbled by how much
more there was to learn, but at the same time, awakened to
and inspired by the elemental power of emotion, dialogue,
and the FBI’s evolving toolbox of applied psychological
tactics to influence and persuade just about anyone in any
situation. In the decades since my initiation into the world of high-
stakes negotiations, I’ve been struck again and again by
how valuable these seemingly simple approaches can be.",
3603,Never split the difference,"The ability to get inside the head—and eventually under the
skin—of your counterpart depends on these techniques and
a willingness to change your approach, based on new
evidence, along the way. As I’ve worked with executives
and students to develop these skills, I always try to reinforce
the message that being right isn’t the key to a successful
negotiation—having the right mindset is. HOW TO CONFRONT—AND GET YOUR WAY—
WITHOUT CONFRONTATION
I only half-jokingly refer to mirroring as magic or a Jedi
mind trick because it gives you the ability to disagree
without being disagreeable. To consider just how useful that can be, think of the
average workplace: invariably there is still someone in a
position of authority who arrived at that position through
aggressive assertiveness, sometimes outright intimidation,
with 
“old 
school” 
top-down, 
command-and-control
assumptions that the boss is always right.",
3604,Never split the difference,"And let’s not
delude ourselves: whatever the enlightened rules of the
“new school,” in every environment (work or otherwise)
you will always have to deal with forceful type A people
who prefer consent to collaboration. If you take a pit bull approach with another pit bull, you
generally end up with a messy scene and lots of bruised
feelings and resentment. Luckily, there’s another way
without all the mess. It’s just four simple steps:
1. Use the late-night FM DJ voice. 2. Start with “I’m sorry . . .”
3. Mirror. 4. Silence. At least four seconds, to let the mirror
work its magic on your counterpart. 5. Repeat. One of my students experienced the effectiveness of this
simple process at her workplace, where her impulsive boss
was known for his “drive-bys”: an infuriating practice by
which the boss would suddenly swing by one’s office or
cubicle unannounced with an “urgent,” poorly thought out
assignment that created a lot of unnecessary work.",
3605,Never split the difference,"Past
attempts at any kind of debate created immediate pushback. “There’s a better way” was always interpreted by this boss
as “the lazy way.”
Such a drive-by occurred toward the end of a long
consulting engagement, one that had generated literally
thousands of documents. The boss, still skeptical of
anything “digital,” wanted the security of paper copies. Popping his head into her office, the boss said, “Let’s
make two copies of all the paperwork.”
“I’m sorry, two copies?” she mirrored in response,
remembering not only the DJ voice, but to deliver the mirror
in an inquisitive tone. The intention behind most mirrors
should be “Please, help me understand.” Every time you
mirror someone, they will reword what they’ve said. They
will never say it exactly the same way they said it the first
time. Ask someone, “What do you mean by that?” and
you’re likely to incite irritation or defensiveness.",
3606,Never split the difference,"A mirror,
however, will get you the clarity you want while signaling
respect and concern for what the other person is saying. “Yes,” her boss responded, “one for us and one for the
customer.”
“I’m sorry, so you are saying that the client is asking for
a copy and we need a copy for internal use?”
“Actually, I’ll check with the client—they haven’t asked
for anything. But I definitely want a copy. That’s just how I
do business.”
“Absolutely,” she responded. “Thanks for checking with
the customer. Where would you like to store the in-house
copy? There’s no more space in the file room here.”
“It’s fine. You can store it anywhere,” he said, slightly
perturbed now. “Anywhere?” she mirrored again, with calm concern. When another person’s tone of voice or body language is
inconsistent with his words, a good mirror can be
particularly useful. In this case, it caused her boss to take a nice, long pause
—something he did not often do. My student sat silent.",
3607,Never split the difference,"“As
a matter of fact, you can put them in my office,” he said,
with more composure than he’d had the whole conversation. “I’ll get the new assistant to print it for me after the project is
done. For now, just create two digital backups.”
A day later her boss emailed and wrote simply, “The two
digital backups will be fine.”
Not long after, I received an ecstatic email from this
student: “I was shocked! I love mirrors! A week of work
avoided!”
Mirroring will make you feel awkward as heck when
you first try it. That’s the only hard part about it; the
technique takes a little practice. Once you get the hang of it,
though, it’ll become a conversational Swiss Army knife
valuable in just about every professional and social setting. KEY LESSONS
The language of negotiation is primarily a language of
conversation and rapport: a way of quickly establishing
relationships and getting people to talk and think together.",
3608,Never split the difference,"Which is why when you think of the greatest negotiators of
all time, I’ve got a surprise for you—think Oprah Winfrey. Her daily television show was a case study of a master
practitioner at work: on a stage face-to-face with someone
she has never met, in front of a crowded studio of hundreds,
with millions more watching from home, and a task to
persuade that person in front of her, sometimes against his
or her own best interests, to talk and talk and keep talking,
ultimately sharing with the world deep, dark secrets that
they had held hostage in their own minds for a lifetime.",
3609,Never split the difference,"Look closely at such an interaction after reading this
chapter and suddenly you’ll see a refined set of powerful
skills: a conscious smile to ease the tension, use of subtle
verbal and nonverbal language to signal empathy (and thus
security), a certain downward inflection in the voice,
embrace of specific kinds of questions and avoidance of
others—a whole array of previously hidden skills that will
prove invaluable to you, once you’ve learned to use them. Here are some of the key lessons from this chapter to
remember:
■
A good negotiator prepares, going in, to be
ready for possible surprises; a great negotiator
aims to use her skills to reveal the surprises she is
certain to find. ■
Don’t commit to assumptions; instead, view
them as hypotheses and use the negotiation to
test them rigorously. ■
People who view negotiation as a battle of
arguments become overwhelmed by the voices
in their head. Negotiation is not an act of battle;
it’s a process of discovery.",
3610,Never split the difference,"The goal is to
uncover as much information as possible. ■
To quiet the voices in your head, make your sole
and all-encompassing focus the other person and
what they have to say. ■
Slow. It. Down. Going too fast is one of the
mistakes all negotiators are prone to making. If
we’re too much in a hurry, people can feel as if
they’re not being heard. You risk undermining
the rapport and trust you’ve built. ■
Put a smile on your face. When people are in a
positive frame of mind, they think more quickly,
and are more likely to collaborate and problem-
solve (instead of fight and resist). Positivity
creates mental agility in both you and your
counterpart. There are three voice tones available to negotiators:
1. The late-night FM DJ voice: Use selectively to
make a point. Inflect your voice downward,
keeping it calm and slow. When done properly,
you 
create 
an 
aura 
of 
authority 
and
trustworthiness without triggering defensiveness. 2.",
3611,Never split the difference,"The positive/playful voice: Should be your
default voice. It’s the voice of an easygoing,
good-natured person. Your attitude is light and
encouraging. The key here is to relax and smile
while you’re talking. 3. The direct or assertive voice: Used rarely. Will
cause problems and create pushback. ■
Mirrors work magic. Repeat the last three words
(or the critical one to three words) of what
someone has just said. We fear what’s different
and are drawn to what’s similar. Mirroring is the
art of insinuating similarity, which facilitates
bonding. Use mirrors to encourage the other side
to empathize and bond with you, keep people
talking, buy your side time to regroup, and
encourage your counterparts to reveal their
strategy. CHAPTER 3
DON’T FEEL THEIR PAIN, LABEL
IT
It was 1998 and I was standing in a narrow hallway outside
an apartment on the twenty-seventh floor of a high-rise in
Harlem.",
3612,Never split the difference,"I was the head of the New York City FBI Crisis
Negotiation Team, and that day I was the primary
negotiator. The investigative squad had reported that at least three
heavily armed fugitives were holed up inside. Several days
earlier the fugitives had used automatic weapons in a shoot-
out with a rival gang, so the New York City FBI SWAT
team was arrayed behind me, and our snipers were on
nearby rooftops with rifles trained on the apartment
windows. In tense situations like this, the traditional negotiating
advice is to keep a poker face. Don’t get emotional. Until
recently, most academics and researchers completely
ignored the role of emotion in negotiation. Emotions were
just an obstacle to a good outcome, they said. “Separate the
people from the problem” was the common refrain. But think about that: How can you separate people from
the problem when their emotions are the problem? Especially when they are scared people with guns.",
3613,Never split the difference,"Emotions
are one of the main things that derail communication. Once
people get upset at one another, rational thinking goes out
the window. That’s why, instead of denying or ignoring emotions,
good negotiators identify and influence them. They are able
to precisely label emotions, those of others and especially
their own. And once they label the emotions they talk about
them without getting wound up. For them, emotion is a tool. Emotions aren’t the obstacles, they are the means. The relationship between an emotionally intelligent
negotiator and their counterpart is essentially therapeutic. It
duplicates that of a psychotherapist with a patient. The
psychotherapist pokes and prods to understand his patient’s
problems, and then turns the responses back onto the patient
to get him to go deeper and change his behavior. That’s
exactly what good negotiators do. Getting to this level of emotional intelligence demands
opening up your senses, talking less, and listening more.",
3614,Never split the difference,"You can learn almost everything you need—and a lot more
than other people would like you to know—simply by
watching and listening, keeping your eyes peeled and your
ears open, and your mouth shut. Think about the therapist’s couch as you read the
following sections. You’ll see how a soothing voice, close
listening, and a calm repetition of the words of your
“patient” can get you a lot further than a cold, rational
argument. It may sound touchy-feely, but if you can perceive the
emotions of others, you have a chance to turn them to your
advantage. The more you know about someone, the more
power you have. TACTICAL EMPATHY
We had one big problem that day in Harlem: no telephone
number to call into the apartment. So for six straight hours,
relieved periodically by two FBI agents who were learning
crisis negotiation, I spoke through the apartment door. I used my late-night FM DJ voice. I didn’t give orders in my DJ voice, or ask what the
fugitives wanted.",
3615,Never split the difference,"Instead, I imagined myself in their place. “It looks like you don’t want to come out,” I said
repeatedly. “It seems like you worry that if you open the
door, we’ll come in with guns blazing. It looks like you
don’t want to go back to jail.”
For six hours, we got no response. The FBI coaches
loved my DJ voice. But was it working? And then, when we were almost completely convinced
that no one was inside, a sniper on an adjacent building
radioed that he saw one of the curtains in the apartment
move. The front door of the apartment slowly opened. A
woman emerged with her hands in front of her. I continued talking. All three fugitives came out. None
of them said a word until we had them in handcuffs. Then I asked them the question that was most nagging
me: Why did they come out after six hours of radio silence? Why did they finally give in? All three gave me the same answer. “We didn’t want to get caught or get shot, but you
calmed us down,” they said.",
3616,Never split the difference,"“We finally believed you
wouldn’t go away, so we just came out.”
There is nothing more frustrating or disruptive to any
negotiation than to get the feeling you are talking to
someone who isn’t listening. Playing dumb is a valid
negotiating technique, and “I don’t understand” is a
legitimate response. But ignoring the other party’s position
only builds up frustration and makes them less likely to do
what you want. The opposite of that is tactical empathy. In my negotiating course, I tell my students that empathy
is “the ability to recognize the perspective of a counterpart,
and 
the 
vocalization of that recognition.” That’s an
academic way of saying that empathy is paying attention to
another human being, asking what they are feeling, and
making a commitment to understanding their world. Notice I didn’t say anything about agreeing with the
other person’s values and beliefs or giving out hugs. That’s
sympathy.",
3617,Never split the difference,"What I’m talking about is trying to understand a
situation from another person’s perspective. One step beyond that is tactical empathy. Tactical empathy is understanding the feelings and
mindset of another in the moment and also hearing what is
behind those feelings so you increase your influence in all
the moments that follow. It’s bringing our attention to both
the emotional obstacles and the potential pathways to
getting an agreement done. It’s emotional intelligence on steroids. As a cop in Kansas City, I was curious about how a
select handful of veteran cops managed to talk angry,
violent people out of fights or to get them to put down their
knives and guns. When I asked how they did that, I rarely got more than a
shrug. They couldn’t articulate what they did. But now I
know the answer is tactical empathy. They were able to
think from another person’s point of view while they were
talking with that person and quickly assess what was driving
them.",
3618,Never split the difference,"Most of us enter verbal combat unlikely to persuade
anyone of anything because we only know and care about
our own goals and perspective. But the best officers are
tuned in to the other party—their audience. They know that
if they empathize, they can mold their audience by how they
approach and talk to them. That’s why, if a corrections officer approaches an inmate
expecting him to resist, he often will. But if he approaches
exuding calm, the inmate will be much more likely to be
peaceful. It seems like wizardry, but it’s not. It’s just that
when the officer has his audience clearly in mind, he can
become who he needs to be to handle the situation. Empathy is a classic “soft” communication skill, but it
has a physical basis. When we closely observe a person’s
face, gestures, and tone of voice, our brain begins to align
with theirs in a process called neural resonance, and that lets
us know more fully what they think and feel.",
3619,Never split the difference,"In an fMRI brain-scan experiment,1 researchers at
Princeton University found that neural resonance disappears
when people communicate poorly. The researchers could
predict how well people were communicating by observing
how much their brains were aligned. And they discovered
that people who paid the most attention—good listeners—
could actually anticipate what the speaker was about to say
before he said it. If you want to increase your neural resonance skills, take
a moment right now and practice. Turn your attention to
someone who’s talking near you, or watch a person being
interviewed on TV. As they talk, imagine that you are that
person. Visualize yourself in the position they describe and
put in as much detail as you can, as if you were actually
there. But be warned, a lot of classic deal makers will think
your approach is softheaded and weak. Just ask former secretary of state Hillary Clinton.",
3620,Never split the difference,"A few years ago during a speech at Georgetown
University, Clinton advocated, “showing respect, even for
one’s enemies. Trying to understand and, insofar as
psychologically possible, empathize with their perspective
and point of view.”
You can predict what happened next. A gaggle of
pundits and politicians pounced on her. They called her
statement inane and naïve, and even a sign she had
embraced the Muslim Brotherhood. Some said that she had
blown her chances at a presidential run. The problem with all of that hot air is that she was right. Politics aside, empathy is not about being nice or
agreeing with the other side. It’s about understanding them. Empathy helps us learn the position the enemy is in, why
their actions make sense (to them), and what might move
them. As negotiators we use empathy because it works. Empathy is why the three fugitives came out after six hours
of my late-night DJ voice.",
3621,Never split the difference,"It’s what helped me succeed at
what Sun Tzu called “the supreme art of war”: to subdue the
enemy without fighting. LABELING
Let’s go back to the Harlem doorway for a minute. We didn’t have a lot to go on, but if you’ve got three
fugitives trapped in an apartment on the twenty-seventh
floor of a building in Harlem, they don’t have to say a word
for you to know that they’re worried about two things:
getting killed, and going to jail. So for six straight hours in that sweltering apartment
building hallway, the two FBI negotiating students and I
took turns speaking. We rotated in order to avoid verbal
stumbles and other errors caused by tiredness. And we
stayed relentlessly on message, all three of us saying the
same thing. Now, pay close attention to exactly what we said: “It
looks like you don’t want to come out. It seems like you
worry that if you open the door, we’ll come in with guns
blazing.",
3622,Never split the difference,"It looks like you don’t want to go back to jail.”
We employed our tactical empathy by recognizing and
then verbalizing the predictable emotions of the situation. We didn’t just put ourselves in the fugitives’ shoes. We
spotted their feelings, turned them into words, and then very
calmly and respectfully repeated their emotions back to
them. In a negotiation, that’s called labeling. Labeling is a way of validating someone’s emotion by
acknowledging it. Give someone’s emotion a name and you
show you identify with how that person feels. It gets you
close to someone without asking about external factors you
know nothing about (“How’s your family?”). Think of
labeling as a shortcut to intimacy, a time-saving emotional
hack. Labeling has a special advantage when your counterpart
is tense. Exposing negative thoughts to daylight—“It looks
like you don’t want to go back to jail”—makes them seem
less frightening.",
3623,Never split the difference,"In one brain imaging study,2 psychology professor
Matthew Lieberman of the University of California, Los
Angeles, found that when people are shown photos of faces
expressing strong emotion, the brain shows greater activity
in the amygdala, the part that generates fear. But when they
are asked to label the emotion, the activity moves to the
areas that govern rational thinking. In other words, labeling
an emotion—applying rational words to a fear—disrupts its
raw intensity. Labeling is a simple, versatile skill that lets you reinforce
a good aspect of the negotiation, or diffuse a negative one. But it has very specific rules about form and delivery. That
makes it less like chatting than like a formal art such as
Chinese calligraphy. For most people, it’s one of the most awkward
negotiating tools to use.",
3624,Never split the difference,"Before they try it the first time, my
students almost always tell me they expect their counterpart
to jump up and shout, “Don’t you dare tell me how I feel!”
Let me let you in on a secret: people never even notice. The first step to labeling is detecting the other person’s
emotional state. Outside that door in Harlem we couldn’t
even see the fugitives, but most of the time you’ll have a
wealth of information from the other person’s words, tone,
and body language. We call that trinity “words, music, and
dance.”
The trick to spotting feelings is to pay close attention to
changes people undergo when they respond to external
events. Most often, those events are your words.",
3625,Never split the difference,"If you say, “How is the family?” and the corners of the
other party’s mouth turn down even when they say it’s
great, you might detect that all is not well; if their voice goes
flat when a colleague is mentioned, there could be a
problem 
between 
the 
two; 
and 
if 
your 
landlord
unconsciously fidgets his feet when you mention the
neighbors, it’s pretty clear that he doesn’t think much of
them (we’ll dig deeper into how to spot and use these cues
in Chapter 9). Picking up on these tiny pieces of information is how
psychics work. They size up their client’s body language
and ask him a few innocent questions. When they “tell” his
future a few minutes later, they’re really just saying what he
wants to hear based on small details they’ve spotted. More
than a few psychics would make good negotiators for that
very reason. Once you’ve spotted an emotion you want to highlight,
the next step is to label it aloud. Labels can be phrased as
statements or questions.",
3626,Never split the difference,"The only difference is whether you
end the sentence with a downward or upward inflection. But
no matter how they end, labels almost always begin with
roughly the same words:
It seems like . . . It sounds like . . . It looks like . . . Notice we said “It sounds like . . .” and not “I’m hearing
that . . .” That’s because the word “I” gets people’s guard
up. When you say “I,” it says you’re more interested in
yourself than the other person, and it makes you take
personal responsibility for the words that follow—and the
offense they might cause. But when you phrase a label as a neutral statement of
understanding, it encourages your counterpart to be
responsive. They’ll usually give a longer answer than just
“yes” or “no.” And if they disagree with the label, that’s
okay. You can always step back and say, “I didn’t say that
was what it was. I just said it seems like that.”
The last rule of labeling is silence. Once you’ve thrown
out a label, be quiet and listen.",
3627,Never split the difference,"We all have a tendency to
expand on what we’ve said, to finish, “It seems like you like
the way that shirt looks,” with a specific question like
“Where did you get it?” But a label’s power is that it invites
the other person to reveal himself. If you’ll trust me for a second, take a break now and try
it out: Strike up a conversation and put a label on one of the
other person’s emotions—it doesn’t matter if you’re talking
to the mailman or your ten-year-old daughter—and then go
silent. Let the label do its work. NEUTRALIZE THE NEGATIVE, REINFORCE THE
POSITIVE
Labeling is a tactic, not a strategy, in the same way a spoon
is a great tool for stirring soup but it’s not a recipe. How you
use labeling will go a long way in determining your success. Deployed well, it’s how we as negotiators identify and then
slowly alter the inner voices of our counterpart’s
consciousness to something more collaborative and trusting. First, let’s talk a little human psychology.",
3628,Never split the difference,"In basic terms,
people’s emotions have two levels: the “presenting”
behavior is the part above the surface you can see and hear;
beneath, the “underlying” feeling is what motivates the
behavior. Imagine a grandfather who’s grumbly at a family
holiday dinner: the presenting behavior is that he’s cranky,
but the underlying emotion is a sad sense of loneliness from
his family never seeing him. What good negotiators do when labeling is address those
underlying emotions. Labeling negatives diffuses them (or
defuses them, in extreme cases); labeling positives
reinforces them. We’ll come back to the cranky grandfather in a moment. First, though, I want to talk a little bit about anger. As an emotion, anger is rarely productive—in you or the
person you’re negotiating with. It releases stress hormones
and neurochemicals that disrupt your ability to properly
evaluate and respond to situations.",
3629,Never split the difference,"And it blinds you to the
fact that you’re angry in the first place, which gives you a
false sense of confidence. That’s not to say that negative feelings should be
ignored. That can be just as damaging. Instead, they should
be teased out. Labeling is a helpful tactic in de-escalating
angry confrontations, because it makes the person
acknowledge their feelings rather than continuing to act out. Early on in my hostage negotiation career, I learned how
important it was to go directly at negative dynamics in a
fearless but deferential manner. It was to fix a situation I’d created myself. I’d angered
the top FBI official in Canada when I entered the country
without first alerting him (so he could notify the Department
of State), a procedure known as “country clearance.”
I knew I needed to call and assuage him to straighten out
the situation, or I risked being expelled. Top guys like to
feel on top. They don’t want to be disrespected.",
3630,Never split the difference,"All the
more so when the office they run isn’t a sexy assignment. “Bless me, Father, for I have sinned,” I said when he
answered the phone. There was a long pause at the other end of the line. “Who is this?” he said. “Bless me, Father, for I have sinned,” I repeated. “It’s
Chris Voss.”
Again there was a long silence. “Does your boss know you’re here?”
I said he did, and crossed my fingers. At this point, the
FBI official would have been completely within his rights to
tell me to leave Canada immediately. But by mentioning the
negative dynamic, I knew I’d diffused it as much as I could. I had a chance. “All right, you’ve got country clearance,” he finally said. “I’ll take care of the paperwork.”
Try this the next time you have to apologize for a bone-
headed mistake. Go right at it. The fastest and most efficient
means of establishing a quick working relationship is to
acknowledge the negative and diffuse it.",
3631,Never split the difference,"Whenever I was
dealing with the family of a hostage, I started out by saying
I knew they were scared. And when I make a mistake—
something that happens a lot—I always acknowledge the
other person’s anger. I’ve found the phrase “Look, I’m an
asshole” to be an amazingly effective way to make
problems go away. That approach has never failed me. Let’s go back to the cranky grandfather. He’s grumpy because he never sees the family and he
feels left out. So he’s speaking up in his own dysfunctional
way to get attention. How do you fix that? Instead of addressing his grumpy behavior, you
acknowledge his sadness in a nonjudgmental way. You
head him off before he can really get started. “We don’t see each other all that often,” you could say. “It seems like you feel like we don’t pay any attention to
you and you only see us once a year, so why should you
make time for us?”
Notice how that acknowledges the situation and labels
his sadness?",
3632,Never split the difference,"Here you can pause briefly, letting him
recognize and appreciate your attempts to understand what
he’s feeling, and then turn the situation around by offering a
positive solution. “For us this is a real treat. We want to hear what you
have to talk about. We want to value this time with you
because we feel left out of your life.”
Research shows that the best way to deal with negativity
is to observe it, without reaction and without judgment. Then consciously label each negative feeling and replace it
with positive, compassionate, and solution-based thoughts. One of my Georgetown University students, a guy named
TJ, who worked as an assistant controller at the Washington
Redskins, put that lesson to work while he was taking my
negotiations class. The economy was in the toilet at the time, and Redskins
season ticket holders were leaving in droves to avoid the
cost. Worse, the team had been terrible the year before, and
off-field player problems were alienating the fans.",
3633,Never split the difference,"The team’s CFO was getting more worried—and cranky
—by the day, and two weeks before the season was to start
he walked by TJ’s desk and slammed down a folder full of
paper. “Better yesterday than today,” he said and walked away. Inside was a list of forty season ticket holders who
hadn’t paid their bills, a USB drive with a spreadsheet about
each one’s situation, and a script to use when calling them. TJ saw right away that the script was a disaster. It began
by saying that his colleagues had been trying to call for
months, and the account had been escalated to him. “I
wanted to inform you,” it read, “that in order to receive your
tickets for the upcoming season opener against the New
York Giants, you will need to pay your outstanding balance
in full prior to September 10.”
It was the stupidly aggressive, impersonal, tone-deaf
style of communication that is the default for most business. It was all “me, me, me” from TJ, with no acknowledgment
of the ticket holder’s situation.",
3634,Never split the difference,"No empathy. No connection. Just give me the money. Maybe I don’t need to say it, but the script didn’t work. TJ left messages; no one called back. A few weeks into the class, TJ rewrote the script. These
weren’t massive changes, and he didn’t offer the fans any
discounts. What he did was add subtle tweaks to make the
call about the fans, their situation, and their love of the team. Now the team was “YOUR Washington Redskins” and
the purpose of the call was to ensure that the team’s most
valuable fans—the delinquent customers—would be there at
the season opener. “The home-field advantage created by
you each and every Sunday at FedEx Field does not go
unnoticed,” TJ wrote.",
3635,Never split the difference,"He then told them, “In these difficult
times, we understand our fans have been hit hard and we are
here to work with you,” and asked the ticket holders to call
back to talk through their “unique situation.”
Though superficially simple, the changes TJ made in the
script had a deep emotional resonance with the delinquent
ticket holders. It mentioned their debt to the team but also
acknowledged the team’s debt to them, and by labeling the
tough economic times, and the stress they were causing, it
diffused the biggest negative dynamic—their delinquency—
and turned the issue into something solvable. The simple changes masked a complex understanding of
empathy on TJ’s side. With the new script, TJ was able to
set up payment plans with all the ticket holders before the
Giants game. And the CFO’s next visit? Well, it was far less
terse. CLEAR THE ROAD BEFORE ADVERTISING THE
DESTINATION
Remember the amygdala, the part of the brain that generates
fear in reaction to threats?",
3636,Never split the difference,"Well, the faster we can interrupt
the amygdala’s reaction to real or imaginary threats, the
faster we can clear the road of obstacles, and the quicker we
can generate feelings of safety, well-being, and trust. We do that by labeling the fears. These labels are so
powerful because they bathe the fears in sunlight, bleaching
them of their power and showing our counterpart that we
understand. Think back to that Harlem landing: I didn’t say, “It
seems like you want us to let you go.” We could all agree
on that. But that wouldn’t have diffused the real fear in the
apartment, or shown that I empathized with the grim
complexity of their situation. That’s why I went right at the
amygdala and said, “It seems like you don’t want to go back
to jail.”
Once they’ve been labeled and brought into the open,
the negative reactions in your counterpart’s amygdala will
begin to soften. I promise it will shock you how suddenly
his language turns from worry to optimism. Empathy is a
powerful mood enhancer.",
3637,Never split the difference,"The road is not always cleared so easily, so don’t be
demoralized if this process seems to go slowly. The Harlem
high-rise negotiation took six hours. Many of us wear fears
upon fears, like layers against the cold, so getting to safety
takes time. That was the experience of another one of my students, a
fund-raiser for the Girl Scouts, who backed into naming her
counterpart’s fears almost accidentally. We’re not talking about someone who sold Girl Scout
cookies: my student was an experienced fund-raiser who
regularly got donors to pony up $1,000 to $25,000 a check. Over the years, she’d developed a very successful system to
get her “clients,” usually wealthy women, to open their
checkbook. She’d invite a potential donor to her office, serve a few
Girl Scouts cookies, walk her through an album of
heartwarming snapshots and handwritten letters from
projects that matched the woman’s profile, and then collect
a check when the donor’s eyes lit up. It was almost easy.",
3638,Never split the difference,"One day, though, she met the immovable donor. Once
the woman sat down in her office, my student began to
throw out the projects her research had said would fit. But
the woman shook her head at one project after another. My student found herself growing perplexed at the
difficult donor who had no interest in donating. But she held
her emotion in check and reached back to a lesson from my
recent class on labeling. “I’m sensing some hesitation with
these projects,” she said in what she hoped was a level
voice. As if she’d been uncorked, the woman exclaimed: “I
want my gift to directly support programming for Girl
Scouts and not anything else.”
This helped focus the conversation, but as my student
put forth project after project that seemed to fulfill the
donor’s criteria, all she got was still rejection. Sensing the potential donor’s growing frustration, and
wanting to end on a positive note so that they might be able
to meet again, my student used another label.",
3639,Never split the difference,"“It seems that
you are really passionate about this gift and want to find the
right project reflecting the opportunities and life-changing
experiences the Girl Scouts gave you.”
And with that, this “difficult” woman signed a check
without even picking a specific project. “You understand
me,” she said as she got up to leave. “I trust you’ll find the
right project.”
Fear of her money being misappropriated was the
presenting dynamic that the first label uncovered. But the
second label uncovered the underlying dynamic—her very
presence in the office was driven by very specific memories
of being a little Girl Scout and how it changed her life. The obstacle here wasn’t finding the right match for the
woman. It wasn’t that she was this highly finicky, hard-to-
please donor. The real obstacle was that this woman needed
to feel that she was understood, that the person handling her
money knew why she was in that office and understood the
memories that were driving her actions.",
3640,Never split the difference,"That’s why labels are so powerful and so potentially
transformative to the state of any conversation. By digging
beneath what seems like a mountain of quibbles, details, and
logistics, labels help to uncover and identify the primary
emotion driving almost all of your counterpart’s behavior,
the 
emotion 
that, 
once 
acknowledged, 
seems 
to
miraculously solve everything else. DO AN ACCUSATION AUDIT
On the first day of negotiating class each semester, I march
the group through an introductory exercise called “sixty
seconds or she dies.” I play a hostage-taker and a student
has to convince me to release my hostage within a minute. It’s an icebreaker that shows me the level of my students,
and it reveals to them how much they need to learn. (Here’s
a little secret: the hostage never gets out.)
Sometimes students jump right in, but finding takers is
usually hard because it means coming to the front of the
class and competing with the guy who holds all the cards.",
3641,Never split the difference,"If
I just ask for a volunteer, my students sit on their hands and
look away. You’ve been there. You can almost feel your
back muscles tense as you think, Oh please, don’t call on
me. So I don’t ask. Instead, I say, “In case you’re worried
about volunteering to role-play with me in front of the class,
I want to tell you in advance . . . it’s going to be horrible.”
After the laughter dies down, I then say, “And those of
you who do volunteer will probably get more out of this
than anyone else.”
I always end up with more volunteers than I need. Now, look at what I did: I prefaced the conversation by
labeling my audience’s fears; how much worse can
something be than “horrible”? I defuse them and wait,
letting it sink in and thereby making the unreasonable seem
less forbidding. All of us have intuitively done something close to this
thousands of times. You’ll start a criticism of a friend by
saying, “I don’t want this to sound harsh . . .” hoping that
whatever comes next will be softened.",
3642,Never split the difference,"Or you’ll say, “I
don’t want to seem like an asshole . . .” hoping your
counterpart will tell you a few sentences later that you’re not
that bad. The small but critical mistake this commits is
denying the negative. That actually gives it credence. In court, defense lawyers do this properly by mentioning
everything their client is accused of, and all the weaknesses
of their case, in the opening statement. They call this
technique “taking the sting out.”
What I want to do here is turn this into a process that,
applied systematically, you can use to disarm your
counterpart while negotiating everything from your son’s
bedtime to large business contracts. The first step of doing so is listing every terrible thing
your counterpart could say about you, in what I call an
accusation audit. This idea of an accusation audit is really, really hard for
people to get their minds around. The first time I tell my
students about it, they say, “Oh my God.",
3643,Never split the difference,"We can’t do that.”
It seems both artificial and self-loathing. It seems like it
would make things worse. But then I remind them that it’s
exactly what I did the first day of class when I labeled their
fears of the hostage game in advance. And they all admit
that none of them knew. As an example, I’m going to use the experience of one
of my students, Anna, because I couldn’t be more proud at
how she turned what she learned in my class into $1 million. At the time, Anna was representing a major government
contractor. Her firm had won a competition for a sizable
government deal by partnering with a smaller company,
let’s call it ABC Corp., whose CEO had a close relationship
with the government client representative. Problems started right after they won the contract,
though. Because ABC’s relationship had been instrumental
in winning the deal, ABC felt that it was owed a piece of the
pie whether it fulfilled its part of the contract or not.",
3644,Never split the difference,"And so, while the contract paid them for the work of
nine people, they continually cut back support. As Anna’s
company had to perform ABC’s work, the relationship
between ABC and Anna’s company fragmented into
vituperative emails and bitter complaining. Facing an
already low profit margin, Anna’s company was forced into
tough negotiations to get ABC to take a cut to 5.5 people. The negotiations left a bitter aftertaste on both sides. The
vituperative emails stopped, but then again a l l emails
stopped. And no communication is always a bad sign. A few months after those painful talks, the client
demanded a major rethink on the project and Anna’s firm
was faced with losing serious money if it didn’t get ABC to
agree to further cuts. Because ABC wasn’t living up to its
side of the bargain, Anna’s firm would have had strong
contractual grounds to cut out ABC altogether.",
3645,Never split the difference,"But that
would have damaged Anna’s firm’s reputation with a very
important customer, and could have led to litigation from
ABC. Faced with this scenario, Anna set up a meeting with
ABC where she and her partners planned to inform ABC
that its pay was being cut to three people. It was a touchy
situation, as ABC was already unhappy about the first cut. Even though she was normally an aggressive and confident
negotiator, worries about the negotiations ruined Anna’s
sleep for weeks. She needed to extract concessions while
improving the relationship at the same time. No easy task,
right? To prepare, the first thing Anna did was sit down with
her negotiating partner, Mark, and list every negative charge
that ABC could level at them. The relationship had gone
sour long before, so the list was huge.",
3646,Never split the difference,"But the biggest
possible accusations were easy to spot:
“You are the typical prime contractor trying to force out
the small guy.”
“You promised us we would have all this work and you
reneged on your promise.”
“You could have told us about this issue weeks ago to
help us prepare.”
Anna and Mark then took turns role-playing the two
sides, with one playing ABC and the other disarming these
accusations with anticipatory labels. “You’re going to think
we are a big, bad prime contractor when we are done,”
Anna practiced saying slowly and naturally. “It seems you
feel this work was promised to you from the beginning,”
Mark said. They trained in front of an observer, honing their
pacing; deciding at what point they would label each fear;
and planning when to include meaningful pauses. It was
theater. When the day of the meeting arrived, Anna opened by
acknowledging ABC’s biggest gripes. “We understand that
we brought you on board with the shared goal of having
you lead this work,” she said.",
3647,Never split the difference,"“You may feel like we have
treated you unfairly, and that we changed the deal
significantly since then. We acknowledge that you believe
you were promised this work.”
This received an emphatic nod from the ABC
representatives, so Anna continued by outlining the situation
in a way that encouraged the ABC reps to see the firms as
teammates, peppering her statements with open-ended
questions that showed she was listening: “What else is there
you feel is important to add to this?”
By labeling the fears and asking for input, Anna was
able to elicit an important fact about ABC’s fears, namely
that ABC was expecting this to be a high-profit contract
because it thought Anna’s firm was doing quite well from
the deal. This provided an entry point for Mark, who explained
that the client’s new demands had turned his firm’s profits
into losses, meaning that he and Anna needed to cut ABC’s
pay further, to three people. Angela, one of ABC’s
representatives, gasped.",
3648,Never split the difference,"“It sounds like you think we are the big, bad prime
contractor trying to push out the small business,” Anna said,
heading off the accusation before it could be made. “No, no, we don’t think that,” Angela said, conditioned
by the acknowledgment to look for common ground. With the negatives labeled and the worst accusations laid
bare, Anna and Mark were able to turn the conversation to
the contract. Watch what they do closely, as it’s brilliant:
they acknowledge ABC’s situation while simultaneously
shifting the onus of offering a solution to the smaller
company. “It sounds like you have a great handle on how the
government contract should work,” Anna said, labeling
Angela’s expertise. “Yes—but I know that’s not how it always goes,”
Angela 
answered, 
proud 
to 
have 
her 
experience
acknowledged. Anna then asked Angela how she would amend the
contract so that everyone made some money, which pushed
Angela to admit that she saw no way to do so without
cutting ABC’s worker count.",
3649,Never split the difference,"Several weeks later, the contract was tweaked to cut
ABC’s payout, which brought Anna’s company $1 million
that put the contract into the black. But it was Angela’s
reaction at the end of the meeting that most surprised Anna. After Anna had acknowledged that she had given Angela
some bad news and that she understood how angry she must
feel, Angela said:
“This is not a good situation but we appreciate the fact
that you are acknowledging what happened, and we don’t
feel like you are mistreating us. And you are not the ‘Big
Bad Prime.’”
Anna’s reaction to how this turned out? “Holy crap, this
stuff actually works!”
She’s right. As you just saw, the beauty of going right
after negativity is that it brings us to a safe zone of empathy. Every one of us has an inherent, human need to be
understood, to connect with the person across the table. That
explains why, after Anna labeled Angela’s fears, Angela’s
first instinct was to add nuance and detail to those fears.",
3650,Never split the difference,"And that detail gave Anna the power to accomplish what
she wanted from the negotiation. GET A SEAT—AND AN UPGRADE—ON A SOLD-OUT
FLIGHT
Up to this point, we’ve been building each skill as if they
were musical instruments: first, try the saxophone mirror;
now here’s the bass label; and finally, why don’t you blow a
note on the French horn of tactical silence. But in a real
negotiation the band all plays together. So you’ve got to
learn how to conduct. Keeping all the instruments playing is really awkward
for most people. It seems to go by in such a rush. So what
I’m going to do here is play a song at slow speed so you can
hear each instrument note by note. I promise you’ll quickly
see how the skills you have been building play off one
another, rising, riffing, falling, and pausing in perfect
harmony. Here is the situation (the song, if you will): My student
Ryan B. was flying from Baltimore to Austin to sign a large
computer-consulting contract.",
3651,Never split the difference,"For six months, the client
representative had gone back and forth on whether he
wanted the services, but a major system collapse put the
representative in a tight spot with his CEO. To shift the
blame, he called Ryan with his CEO on the line and very
aggressively demanded to know why it was taking Ryan so
long to come ink the contract. If Ryan was not there by
Friday morning, he said, the deal was off. Ryan bought a ticket for the next morning, Thursday,
but a freak lightning storm whipped up in Baltimore, closing
the airport for five hours. It became painfully clear that
Ryan wasn’t going to make his original connection to
Austin from Dallas. Worse, when he called American
Airlines just before departing, he found that his connection
had been automatically rebooked to 3 p.m. the next day,
putting the contract in jeopardy. When Ryan finally got to Dallas at 8 p.m., he ran to the
gate where the day’s final American Airlines flight to Austin
was less than thirty minutes from takeoff.",
3652,Never split the difference,"His goal was to
get on that flight or, at worst, get an earlier flight the next
day. In front of him at the gate, a very aggressive couple was
yelling at the gate agent, who was barely looking at them as
she tapped on the computer in front of her; she was clearly
making every effort not to scream back. After she’d said,
“There’s nothing I can do,” five times, the angry couple
finally gave up and left. To start, watch how Ryan turns that heated exchange to
his advantage. Following on the heels of an argument is a
great position for a negotiator, because your counterpart is
desperate for an empathetic connection. Smile, and you’re
already an improvement. “Hi, Wendy, I’m Ryan. It seems like they were pretty
upset.”
This labels the negative and establishes a rapport based
on empathy. This in turn encourages Wendy to elaborate on
her situation, words Ryan then mirrors to invite her to go
further. “Yeah. They missed their connection.",
3653,Never split the difference,"We’ve had a fair
amount of delays because of the weather.”
“The weather?”
After Wendy explains how the delays in the Northeast
had rippled through the system, Ryan again labels the
negative and then mirrors her answer to encourage her to
delve further. “It seems like it’s been a hectic day.”
“There’ve been a lot of ‘irate consumers,’ you know? I
mean, I get it, even though I don’t like to be yelled at. A lot
of people are trying to get to Austin for the big game.”
“The big game?”
“UT is playing Ole Miss football and every flight into
Austin has been booked solid.”
“Booked solid?”
Now let’s pause. Up to this point, Ryan has been using
labels and mirrors to build a relationship with Wendy. To
her it must seem like idle chatter, though, because he hasn’t
asked for anything. Unlike the angry couple, Ryan is
acknowledging her situation. His words ping-pong between
“What’s that?” and “I hear you,” both of which invite her to
elaborate.",
3654,Never split the difference,"Now that the empathy has been built, she lets slip a piece
of information he can use. “Yeah, all through the weekend. Though who knows
how many people will make the flights. The weather’s
probably going to reroute a lot of people through a lot of
different places.”
Here’s where Ryan finally swoops in with an ask. But
notice how he acts: not assertive or coldly logical, but with
empathy and labeling that acknowledges her situation and
tacitly puts them in the same boat. “Well, it seems like you’ve been handling the rough day
pretty well,” he says. “I was also affected by the weather
delays and missed my connecting flight. It seems like this
flight is likely booked solid, but with what you said, maybe
someone affected by the weather might miss this
connection. Is there any possibility a seat will be open?”
Listen to that riff: Label, tactical empathy, label. And
only then a request. At this point, Wendy says nothing and begins typing on
her computer.",
3655,Never split the difference,"Ryan, who’s eager not to talk himself out of a
possible deal, engages in some silence. After thirty seconds,
Wendy prints a boarding pass and hands it to Ryan,
explaining that there were a few seats that were supposed to
be filled by people who would now arrive much later than
the flight’s departure. To make Ryan’s success even better,
she puts him in Economy Plus seating. All that in under two minutes! The next time you find yourself following an angry
customer at a corner store or airplane line, take a moment
and practice labels and mirrors on the service person. I
promise they won’t scream, “Don’t try to control me!” and
burst into flames—and you might walk away with a little
more than you expected. KEY LESSONS
As you try to insert the tools of tactical empathy into your
daily life, I encourage you to think of them as extensions of
natural human interactions and not artificial conversational
tics.",
3656,Never split the difference,"In any interaction, it pleases us to feel that the other side
is listening and acknowledging our situation. Whether you
are negotiating a business deal or simply chatting to the
person at the supermarket butcher counter, creating an
empathetic relationship and encouraging your counterpart to
expand on their situation is the basis of healthy human
interaction. These tools, then, are nothing less than emotional best
practices that help you cure the pervasive ineptitude that
marks our most critical conversations in life. They will help
you connect and create more meaningful and warm
relationships. That they might help you extract what you
want is a bonus; human connection is the first goal. With that in mind, I encourage you to take the risk of
sprinkling these in every conversation you have. I promise
you that they will feel awkward and artificial at first, but
keep at it. Learning to walk felt awfully strange, too.",
3657,Never split the difference,"As you internalize these techniques, turning the artifice
of tactical empathy into a habit and then into an integral part
of your personality, keep in mind these lessons from the
chapter you’ve just read:
■
Imagine yourself in your counterpart’s situation. The beauty of empathy is that it doesn’t demand
that you agree with the other person’s ideas (you
may 
well 
find 
them 
crazy). But 
by
acknowledging the other person’s situation, you
immediately convey that you are listening. And
once they know that you are listening, they may
tell you something that you can use. ■
The reasons why a counterpart will not make an
agreement with you are often more powerful
than why they will make a deal, so focus first on
clearing the barriers to agreement. Denying
barriers or negative influences gives them
credence; get them into the open. ■
Pause. After you label a barrier or mirror a
statement, let it sink in. Don’t worry, the other
party will fill the silence.",
3658,Never split the difference,"■
Label your counterpart’s fears to diffuse their
power. We all want to talk about the happy stuff,
but remember, the faster you interrupt action in
your counterpart’s amygdala, the part of the
brain that generates fear, the faster you can
generate feelings of safety, well-being, and trust. ■
List the worst things that the other party could
say about you and say them before the other
person can. Performing an accusation audit in
advance prepares you to head off negative
dynamics before they take root. And because
these accusations often sound exaggerated when
said aloud, speaking them will encourage the
other person to claim that quite the opposite is
true. ■
Remember you’re dealing with a person who
wants to be appreciated and understood. So use
labels to reinforce and encourage positive
perceptions and dynamics. CHAPTER 4
BEWARE “YES”—MASTER “NO”
Let me paint a scenario we’ve all experienced: You’re at
home, just before dinner, and the phone rings.",
3659,Never split the difference,"It is, no
surprise, a telemarketer. He wants to sell you magazine
subscriptions, water filters, frozen Argentine beef—to be
honest, it doesn’t matter, as the script is always the same. After butchering your name, and engaging in some
disingenuous pleasantries, he launches into his pitch. The hard sell that comes next is a scripted flowchart
designed to cut off your escape routes as it funnels you
down a path with no exit but “Yes.” “Do you enjoy a nice
glass of water from time to time.” “Well, yes, but . . .” “Me,
too. And like me I bet you like crisp, clean water with no
chemical aftertaste, like Mother Nature made it.” “Well, yes,
but . . .”
Who is this guy with a fake smile in his voice, you
wonder, who thinks he can trick you into buying something
you don’t want? You feel your muscles tighten, your voice
go defensive, and your heart rate accelerate. You feel like his prey, and you are!",
3660,Never split the difference,"The last thing you want to do is say “Yes,” even when
it’s the only way to answer, “Do you drink water?”
Compromise and concession, even to the truth, feels like
defeat. And “No,” well, “No” feels like salvation, like an
oasis. You’re tempted to use “No” when it’s blatantly
untrue, just to hear its sweet sound. “No, I do not need
water, carbon filtered or otherwise. I’m a camel!”
Now let’s think about this selling technique. It’s
designed to get to “Yes” at all costs, as if “No” were death. And for many of us it is. We have all these negative
connotations with “No.” We talk about the rejection of
“No,” about the fear of hearing it. “No” is the ultimate
negative word. But at the end of the day, “Yes” is often a meaningless
answer that hides deeper objections (and “Maybe” is even
worse). Pushing hard for “Yes” doesn’t get a negotiator any
closer to a win; it just angers the other side.",
3661,Never split the difference,"So if “Yes” can be so damn uncomfortable, and “No”
such a relief, why have we fetishized one and demonized
the other? We have it backward. For good negotiators, “No” is pure
gold. That negative provides a great opportunity for you and
the other party to clarify what you really want by
eliminating what you don’t want. “No” is a safe choice that
maintains the status quo; it provides a temporary oasis of
control. At some point in their development, all negotiators have to
come to grips with “No.” When you come to realize the real
psychological dynamic behind it, you’ll love the word. It’s
not just that you lose your fear of it, but that you come to
learn what it does for you and how you can build deals out
of it. “Yes” and “Maybe” are often worthless. But “No”
always alters the conversation. “NO” STARTS THE NEGOTIATION
My fascination with “No” in all its beautiful nuance began
with a conversation I had a few months before my
negotiation career began.",
3662,Never split the difference,"I started my career with the Bureau as a member of the
FBI SWAT team in the Pittsburgh Division but after nearly
two years I was transferred to New York, where the FBI
attached me to the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF). It was
an amazing post: We spent our days and nights tracking
suspected terrorists, investigating their cells, and assessing
whether or how they might strike. We were untying knots of
human anger in the midst of America’s biggest city, making
life-and-death decisions on who was dangerous and who
was just blowing hot air. The work fascinated me. Ever since my first days with the Bureau, I had been
obsessed with crisis response. The immediacy of the task
enthralled me. The stakes were high. Lives hung in the
balance. The emotional terrain was complex, changing, and often
conflicting. To successfully gain a hostage’s safe release, a
negotiator had to penetrate the hostage-taker’s motives, state
of mind, intelligence, and emotional strengths and
weaknesses.",
3663,Never split the difference,"The negotiator played the role of bully,
conciliator, enforcer, savior, confessor, instigator, and
peacemaker—and that’s just a few of the parts. I thought I was cut out for every one of them. A few weeks after I got to Manhattan, I showed up at the
desk of Amy Bonderow, who ran the FBI’s Crisis
Negotiation Team in New York. I didn’t know beans about
negotiating, so I went for the direct approach. “I want be a hostage negotiator,” I said. “Everyone does—got any training?” she asked. “No,” I said. “Any credentials?”
“Nope.” I answered. “Any experience?” she asked. “No,” I answered. “Do you have a degree in psychology, sociology,
anything at all related to negotiation?”
“No.”
“Looks like you answered your own question,” she said. “No. Now go away.”
“Go away?” I protested. “Really?”
“Yep. As in, ‘Leave me alone.’ Everybody wants to be a
hostage negotiator, and you have no résumé, experience, or
skills. So what would you say in my position?",
3664,Never split the difference,"You got it:
‘No.’”
I paused in front of her, thinking, This is not how my
negotiating career ends. I had stared down terrorists; I
wasn’t going to just leave. “Come on,” I said. “There has to be something I can
do.”
Amy shook her head and gave one of those ironic
laughs that mean the person doesn’t think you’ve got a
snowball’s chance in hell. “I’ll tell you what. Yes, there is something you can do:
Volunteer at a suicide hotline. Then come talk to me. No
guarantees, got it?” she said. “Now, seriously, go away.”
My conversation with Amy kicked off my awareness of the
complex and hidden subtleties of conversation, the power of
certain words, the seemingly unintelligible emotional truths
that so often underlie intelligible exchanges. A trap into which many fall is to take what other people
say literally. I started to see that while people played the
game of conversation, it was in the game beneath the game,
where few played, that all the leverage lived.",
3665,Never split the difference,"In our chat, I saw how the word “No”—so apparently
clear and direct—really wasn’t so simple. Over the years,
I’ve thought back repeatedly to that conversation, replaying
how Amy so quickly turned me down, again and again. But
her “No’s” were just the gateway to “Yes.” They gave her—
and me—time to pivot, adjust, and reexamine, and actually
created the environment for the one “Yes” that mattered. While assigned to the JTTF, I worked with an NYPD
lieutenant named Martin. He had a hard shell, and whenever
asked for anything he responded with a terse negative. After
I’d gotten to know him a bit, I asked him why. “Chris,” he
said, proudly, “a lieutenant’s job is to say, ‘No.’”
At first, I thought that sort of automated response
signaled a failure of imagination. But then I realized I did
the same thing with my teenage son, and that after I’d said
“No” to him, I often found that I was open to hearing what
he had to say.",
3666,Never split the difference,"That’s because having protected myself, I could relax
and more easily consider the possibilities. “No” is the start of the negotiation, not the end of it. We’ve been conditioned to fear the word “No.” But it is a
statement of perception far more often than of fact. It
seldom means, “I have considered all the facts and made a
rational choice.” Instead, “No” is often a decision,
frequently temporary, to maintain the status quo. Change is
scary, and “No” provides a little protection from that
scariness. Jim Camp, in his excellent book, Start with NO,1
counsels the reader to give their adversary (his word for
counterpart) permission to say “No” from the outset of a
negotiation. He calls it “the right to veto.” He observes that
people will fight to the death to preserve their right to say
“No,” so give them that right and the negotiating
environment becomes more constructive and collaborative
almost immediately.",
3667,Never split the difference,"When I read Camp’s book, I realized this was something
we’d known as hostage negotiators for years. We’d learned
that the quickest way to get a hostage-taker out was to take
the time to talk them out, as opposed to “demanding” their
surrender. Demanding their surrender, “telling” them to
come out, always ended up creating a much longer standoff
and occasionally, actually contributed to death. It comes down to the deep and universal human need for
autonomy. People need to feel in control. When you
preserve a person’s autonomy by clearly giving them
permission to say “No” to your ideas, the emotions calm,
the effectiveness of the decisions go up, and the other party
can really look at your proposal. They’re allowed to hold it
in their hands, to turn it around. And it gives you time to
elaborate or pivot in order to convince your counterpart that
the change you’re proposing is more advantageous than the
status quo.",
3668,Never split the difference,"Great negotiators seek “No” because they know that’s
often when the real negotiation begins. Politely saying “No” to your opponent (we’ll go into this in
more depth in Chapter 9), calmly hearing “No,” and just
letting the other side know that they are welcome to say
“No” has a positive impact on any negotiation. In fact, your
invitation for the other side to say “No” has an amazing
power to bring down barriers and allow for beneficial
communication. This means you have to train yourself to hear “No” as
something other than rejection, and respond accordingly. When someone tells you “No,” you need to rethink the
word in one of its alternative—and much more real—
meanings:
■
I am not yet ready to agree;
■
You are making me feel uncomfortable;
■
I do not understand;
■
I don’t think I can afford it;
■
I want something else;
■
I need more information; or
■
I want to talk it over with someone else.",
3669,Never split the difference,"Then, after pausing, ask solution-based questions or
simply label their effect:
“What about this doesn’t work for you?”
“What would you need to make it work?”
“It seems like there’s something here that bothers you.”
People have a need to say, “No.” So don’t just hope to
hear it at some point; get them to say it early. PERSUADE IN THEIR WORLD
I’d like to present you with a guy named Joe Businessman
as he readies himself for a negotiation. You’ve met him
before. He’s the prepared type, with all his Getting to Yes
strategies written out and memorized. And he’s more than
ready to unleash them on the guy across the table. Joe
pauses to look at his expensive suit in the mirror, fantasizing
about the impressive things he’ll say and the fancy charts
and graphs that’ll back up those things and leave his
counterpart—his opponent—vanquished and in defeat. He is
Russell Crowe in Gladiator. He is The Man. Now allow me to let you in on a secret: None of that
preparation will mean a damn thing.",
3670,Never split the difference,"His negotiation style is
all me, me, me, ego, ego, ego. And when the people on the
other side of the table pick up those signals, they’re going to
decide that it’s best to politely, even furtively, ignore this
Superman . . . by saying “Yes”! “Huh?” you say. Sure, the word they’ll say right off is “Yes,” but that
word is only a tool to get this blowhard to go away. They’ll
weasel out later, claiming changing conditions, budget
issues, the weather. For now, they just want to be released
because Joe isn’t convincing them of anything; he’s only
convincing himself. I’ll let you in on a secret. There are actually three kinds
of “Yes”: Counterfeit, Confirmation, and Commitment. A counterfeit “yes” is one in which your counterpart
plans on saying “no” but either feels “yes” is an easier
escape route or just wants to disingenuously keep the
conversation going to obtain more information or some
other kind of edge.",
3671,Never split the difference,"A confirmation “yes” is generally
innocent, a reflexive response to a black-or-white question;
it’s sometimes used to lay a trap but mostly it’s just simple
affirmation with no promise of action. And a commitment
“yes” is the real deal; it’s a true agreement that leads to
action, a “yes” at the table that ends with a signature on the
contract. The commitment “yes” is what you want, but the
three types sound almost the same so you have to learn how
to recognize which one is being used. Human beings the world over are so used to being
pursued for the commitment “yes” as a condition to find out
more that they have become masters at giving the
counterfeit “yes.” That’s what the people facing Joe
Businessman are doing, dangling the counterfeit “yes” so
they can hear more. Whether you call it “buy-in” or “engagement” or
something else, good negotiators know that their job isn’t to
put on a great performance but to gently guide their
counterpart to discover their goal as his own.",
3672,Never split the difference,"Let me tell you, I learned that the hard way. Two months after talking with Amy, I started answering
phones for HelpLine, the crisis hotline founded by Norman
Vincent Peale. The basic rule was that you couldn’t be with anybody on
the phone for more than twenty minutes. If you did your
job, it wasn’t going to take you longer than that to get them
to a better place. We had a thick book of organizations we
referred them to for help. It was a paramedic approach:
patch them up and send them on their way. But people in crisis only accounted for about 40 percent
of the calls we got. The majority of the calls came from
frequent callers. These are highly dysfunctional people,
energy vampires whom no one else would listen to
anymore. We kept a list of frequent callers and when you got one,
the first thing you had to do was check to see if the person
had called that day, because they were only allowed one call
a day. They knew it, too. A lot of times, they’d say, “Yeah,
I’m Eddie.",
3673,Never split the difference,"I haven’t called yet today. Go ahead and check
the list. You got to talk to me.”
Since I was there primarily to learn a skill, I loved the
frequent callers. They were a problem, and I loved trying to
figure them out. I felt I had some talent at it. I felt like a
superstar. When it came time for my performance review, they
assigned me a shift supervisor named Jim Snyder. Jim was a
hotline veteran and a sweetheart; the only problem was he
always wanted to joke around. Jim understood that
volunteer burnout was the biggest problem at a hotline, so
he dedicated his time to making work fun. I became good
friends with Jim. For my review, Jim waited until I got a call and went into
the monitoring room where the supervisors could listen to
our calls. The call was from one of my frequent clients, a
cabbie with a fear of going outside and plenty of time to tell
me about it.",
3674,Never split the difference,"This energy vampire (his name was Daryl)
launched into his shtick about how he was going to lose his
house and with it his will to live if he couldn’t work. “Seriously, when was the last time someone tried to hurt
you on the streets?” I asked. “Well, I mean, it’s been a long time,” Daryl said. “Like . . . ?”
“I can’t really remember a date, Chris. Maybe a year, I
guess.”
“So it’s safe to say that the outside world hasn’t been too
hard on you, right?”
“Yes,” Daryl said. “I suppose so.”
We went back and forth like this for a while, as I made
him admit that most of us had little to fear in the world. I
was feeling good about my new skills, about listening to
Daryl and then “CareFronting” him, which was the slightly
goofy name we gave to assertively—but caringly—
responding to frequent callers. It was all flowing, and our rapport was great. I even got
Daryl to laugh a few times. By the time I was done with
him, he couldn’t give me one reason not to step outside.",
3675,Never split the difference,"“Thank you, Chris,” Daryl said just before he hung up. “Thanks for doing such a great job.”
Before I went to see Jim, I leaned back in my chair and
basked in that compliment. How often do you get that from
a man in pain, I thought. Then I sprung up and strode
toward the monitoring room, so proud I was practically
buffing my nails on my shirt and patting my own back. Jim motioned me to the chair in front of him and gave
me his biggest smile. I must have returned it with twice the
wattage. “Well, Chris,” he said, still smiling. “That was one of the
worst calls I ever heard.”
I stared at him, gape-jawed. “Jim, did you hear Daryl congratulate me?” I asked. “I
talked him down, man. I killed it.”
Jim smiled—I hated that smile right then—and nodded. “That’s one of the signs, because they should be
congratulating themselves when they get off the line,” he
said. “They don’t need to be congratulating you. That tells
me you did too much.",
3676,Never split the difference,"If they think you did it—if you were
the guy who killed it—how is he going to help himself? I
don’t want to be harsh, but you were horrible.”
As I listened to what Jim said, I felt that acid stomach
rush you get when you are forced to accept that the guy
dumping on you is completely right. Daryl’s response had
been a kind of “yes,” but it had been anything but a true
commitment “yes.” He’d made no promise to action. His
“yes” had been designed to make me feel good enough to
leave him alone. Daryl may not have known it, but his “yes”
was as counterfeit as they came. You see, that whole call had been about me and my ego
and not the caller. But the only way to get these callers to
take action was to have them own the conversation, to
believe that they were coming to these conclusions, to these
necessary next steps, and that the voice at the other end was
simply a medium for those realizations.",
3677,Never split the difference,"Using all your skills to create rapport, agreement, and
connection with a counterpart is useful, but ultimately that
connection is useless unless the other person feels that they
are equally as responsible, if not solely responsible, for
creating the connection and the new ideas they have. I nodded slowly, the fight drained out of me. “One of the worst calls?” I said to Jim. “That’s right.”
I worked hard at reorienting myself from that point on. I
asked so many questions and read so much about it that
soon they had me teaching two classes for new volunteers at
HelpLine: the opening class, on active listening; and the one
on CareFrontation. Got it, you say. It’s not about me. We need to persuade from
their perspective, not ours. But how? By starting with their most basic wants. In every negotiation, in every agreement, the result
comes from someone else’s decision.",
3678,Never split the difference,"And sadly, if we
believe that we can control or manage others’ decisions with
compromise and logic, we’re leaving millions on the table. But while we can’t control others’ decisions, we can
influence them by inhabiting their world and seeing and
hearing exactly what they want. Though the intensity may differ from person to person,
you can be sure that everyone you meet is driven by two
primal urges: the need to feel safe and secure, and the need
to feel in control. If you satisfy those drives, you’re in the
door. As we saw with my chat with Daryl, you’re not going to
logically convince them that they’re safe, secure, or in
control. Primal needs are urgent and illogical, so arguing
them into a corner is just going to push your counterpart to
flee with a counterfeit “Yes.”
And being “nice” in the form of feigned sympathy is
often equally as unsuccessful. We live in an age that
celebrates niceness under various names.",
3679,Never split the difference,"We are exhorted
to be nice and to respect people’s feelings at all times and in
every situation. But nice alone in the context of negotiation can backfire. Nice, employed as a ruse, is disingenuous and manipulative. Who hasn’t received the short end of the stick in dealings
with a “nice” salesman who took you for a ride? If you rush
in with plastic niceness, your bland smile is going to dredge
up all that baggage. Instead of getting inside with logic or feigned smiles,
then, we get there by asking for “No.” It’s the word that
gives the speaker feelings of safety and control. “No” starts
conversations and creates safe havens to get to the final
“Yes” of commitment. An early “Yes” is often just a cheap,
counterfeit dodge. About five months after she’d told me to “go away,” I
stopped by Amy Bonderow’s office and told her that I’d
volunteered at HelpLine. “You did?” she asked, smiling with surprise. “I tell
everybody to do that.",
3680,Never split the difference,"And nobody ever does.”
It turned out that Amy had started her negotiating career
by volunteering at the same place. She started naming
people who were now mutual friends of ours. We laughed
about Jim. In a sudden shift, Amy stopped speaking and stared at
me. I shifted in my shoes as she gave me the Pause. Then
she smiled. “You get the next position.”
At that time, there were five other people aiming for the
same slot, people who had psychology degrees, experience,
and credentials. But I was on the road to the next hostage
negotiation training course at the FBI Academy in Quantico,
Virginia, ahead of everybody else. My career as a negotiator
had officially begun. “NO” IS PROTECTION
Think back to the telemarketer at the beginning of this
chapter. The obvious reply to his question—“Do you enjoy
a nice glass of water?”—is “Yes.” But all you want to do is
scream, “No!” After a question like that you just know the
rest of the phone call is going to be painful.",
3681,Never split the difference,"That, in a nutshell, distills the inherent contradictions in
the values we give “Yes” and “No.” Whenever we
negotiate, there’s no doubt we want to finish with a “Yes.”
But we mistakenly conflate the positive value of that final
“Yes” with a positive value of “Yes” in general. And
because we see “No” as the opposite of “Yes,” we then
assume that “No” is always a bad thing. Nothing could be further from the truth. Saying “No”
gives the speaker the feeling of safety, security, and control. You use a question that prompts a “No” answer, and your
counterpart feels that by turning you down he has proved
that he’s in the driver’s seat. Good negotiators welcome—
even invite—a solid “No” to start, as a sign that the other
party is engaged and thinking. Gun for a “Yes” straight off the bat, though, and your
counterpart gets defensive, wary, and skittish.",
3682,Never split the difference,"That’s why I
tell my students that, if you’re trying to sell something, don’t
start with “Do you have a few minutes to talk?” Instead ask,
“Is now a bad time to talk?” Either you get “Yes, it is a bad
time” followed by a good time or a request to go away, or
you get “No, it’s not” and total focus. As an exercise, the next time you get a telemarketing
call, write down the questions the seller asks. I promise
you’ll find that your level of discomfort correlates directly to
how quickly he pushes you for “Yes.”
My colleague Marti Evelsizer was the one who first opened
my eyes to why “No” was better than “Yes.”
Marti was the FBI’s Crisis Negotiation Coordinator in
Pittsburgh at the time. She was a dynamo and a negotiating
genius, which earned her huge respect both within the
Bureau and with the local police. But human beings are
innately jealous, and her immediate supervisor was no
exception to that rule. Her success diminished him, and that
made her a threat.",
3683,Never split the difference,"His jealousy got the better of him when the Pittsburgh
Police Department’s Hostage Negotiation Team asked her to
sit on the selection board for their new candidates. Picking
her, and doing so over her boss, was an unprecedented
move. So her boss decided to remove her from her position. For
ignoring her regular duties, he said. But really it was for
being a threat. When Marti sat down with her supervisor for her official
dismissal, her options were few. He had every right to do as
he pleased. Marti told me that she considered a variety of scenarios. She thought about going right at his jealousy and hashing it
out, or explaining how the job would reflect well on the
Bureau: “Would you like our office to be honored for its
expertise?”
But by the time she sat down with him, she had picked
one of the most strongly worded “No”-oriented setup
questions I have ever heard. “Do you want the FBI to be embarrassed?” she said. “No,” he answered. “What do you want me to do?” she responded.",
3684,Never split the difference,"He leaned back in his chair, one of those 1950s faux-
leather numbers that squeak meaningfully when the sitter
shifts. He stared at her over his glasses and then nodded
ever so slightly. He was in control. “Look, you can keep the position,” he said. “Just go
back out there and don’t let it interfere with your other
duties.”
And a minute later Marti walked out with her job intact. When I heard Marti do that, I was like, “Bang!” By pushing
for a “No,” Marti nudged her supervisor into a zone where
he was making the decisions. And then she furthered his
feelings of safety and power with a question inviting him to
define her next move. The important thing here is that Marti not only accepted
the “No”; she searched it out and embraced it. At a recent sales conference, I asked the participants for
the one word they all dread. The entire group yelled, “No!”
To them—and to almost everyone—“No” means one thing:
end of discussion. But that’s not what it means. “No” is not failure.",
3685,Never split the difference,"Used strategically it’s an answer that
opens the path forward. Getting to the point where you’re
no longer horrified by the word “No” is a liberating moment
that every negotiator needs to reach. Because if your biggest
fear is “No,” you can’t negotiate. You’re the hostage of
“Yes.” You’re handcuffed. You’re done. So let’s undress “No.” It’s a reaffirmation of autonomy. It is not a use or abuse of power; it is not an act of rejection;
it is not a manifestation of stubbornness; it is not the end of
the negotiation. In fact, “No” often opens the discussion up. The sooner
you say “No,” the sooner you’re willing to see options and
opportunities that you were blind to previously. Saying
“No” often spurs people to action because they feel they’ve
protected themselves and now see an opportunity slipping
away. Since I’ve demystified “No” for myself, I’ve found the
ideas, perceptions, and baggage that people have with that
two-letter word to be fascinating.",
3686,Never split the difference,"To me, it’s like watching a
movie or a music video from the 1980s for the umpteenth
time. You can identify with the experience—while
simultaneously being conscious of the fact that the world,
and you, have moved on. Today, I coach my students to learn to see “No” for what
it is. Rather than harming them or those they negotiate with,
“No” protects and benefits all parties in an exchange. “No”
creates safety, security, and the feeling of control. It’s a
requirement to implementable success. It’s a pause, a nudge,
and a chance for the speaker to articulate what they do want. As you can see, “No” has a lot of skills.",
3687,Never split the difference,"■
“No” allows the real issues to be brought forth;
■
“No” protects people from making—and lets
them correct—ineffective decisions;
■
“No” slows things down so that people can
freely 
embrace 
their 
decisions 
and 
the
agreements they enter into;
■
“No” helps people feel safe, secure, emotionally
comfortable, and in control of their decisions;
■
“No” moves everyone’s efforts forward. One of my grad school students, a political fund-raiser
named Ben Ottenhoff, drove home this lesson with a bang. For years, he’d been using a traditional “Yes pattern” fund-
raising script to raise money for Republican congressional
candidates. FUND-RAISER: Hello, can I speak with Mr. Smith? MR. SMITH: Yes, this is he. FUND-RAISER: I’m calling from the XYZ Committee,
and I wanted to ask you a few important questions
about your views on our economy today. Do you
believe that gas prices are currently too high? MR. SMITH: Yes, gas prices are much too high and
hurting my family.",
3688,Never split the difference,"FUND-RAISER: Do you believe that the Democrats are
part of the problem when it comes to high gas
prices? MR. SMITH: Yes, President Obama is a bad person
FUND-RAISER: Do you think we need change in
November? MR. SMITH: Yes, I do. FUND-RAISER: Can you give me your credit card
number so you can be a part of that change? In theory at least, the “Yes” answers built up a reservoir
of positivity that exploded into donations when requested at
the end of the script. The problem, in reality, was that the
“Yes pattern” scripts had been giving poor rates of return
for years. All the steps were “Yes,” but the final answer was
invariably “No.”
Then Ben read Jim Camp’s book Start with NO in my
class and began to wonder if “No” could be a tool to boost
donations. Ben knew that giving the potential donors a no-
hard-feelings way to get off the call was going to be a tough
sell to his grassroots fund-raisers, because it goes against
everything they had been trained to do.",
3689,Never split the difference,"But Ben’s a smart
guy, so instead of totally swapping scripts he had a small
group of his grassroots guys test-market a “No”-oriented
script. FUND-RAISER: Hello, can I speak with Mr. Smith? MR. SMITH: Yes, this is he. FUND-RAISER: I’m calling from the XYZ Committee,
and I wanted to ask you a few important questions
about your views on our economy today. Do you
feel that if things stay the way they are, America’s
best days are ahead of it? MR. SMITH: No, things will only get worse. FUND-RAISER: Are you going to sit and watch
President Obama take the White House in November
without putting up a fight? MR. SMITH: No, I’m going to do anything I can to
make sure that doesn’t happen. FUND-RAISER: If you want do something today to
make sure that doesn’t happen, you can give to XYZ
Committee, which is working hard to fight for you. See how clearly that swaps “Yes” for “No” and offers to
take a donation if Mr. Smith wants? It puts Mr. Smith in the
driver’s seat; he’s in charge. And it works!",
3690,Never split the difference,"In a truly
remarkable turnaround, the “No”-oriented script got a 23
percent better rate of return. The only sad part of Ben’s tale is that despite the huge
improvement in results, he couldn’t roll out the script to all
his fund-raisers. It went against fund-raising orthodoxy, and
longtime fund-raisers like the fake comfort of the “Yes.”
Genius is often missed the first time around, right? One negotiating genius who’s impossible to miss is Mark
Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks. I
always quote to my students one of his best lines on
negotiation: “Every ‘No’ gets me closer to a ‘Yes.’” But
then I remind them that extracting those “No’s” on the road
to “Yes” isn’t always easy. There is a big difference between making your
counterpart feel that they can say “No” and actually getting
them to say it.",
3691,Never split the difference,"Sometimes, if you’re talking to somebody
who is just not listening, the only way you can crack their
cranium is to antagonize them into “No.”
One great way to do this is to mislabel one of the other
party’s emotions or desires. You say something that you
know is totally wrong, like “So it seems that you really are
eager to leave your job” when they clearly want to stay. That forces them to listen and makes them comfortable
correcting you by saying, “No, that’s not it. This is it.”
Another way to force “No” in a negotiation is to ask the
other party what they don’t want. “Let’s talk about what you
would say ‘No’ to,” you’d say. And people are comfortable
saying “No” here because it feels like self-protection. And
once you’ve gotten them to say “No,” people are much
more open to moving forward toward new options and
ideas. “No”—or the lack thereof—also serves as a warning, the
canary in the coal mine.",
3692,Never split the difference,"If despite all your efforts, the other
party won’t say “No,” you’re dealing with people who are
indecisive or confused or who have a hidden agenda. In
cases like that you have to end the negotiation and walk
away. Think of it like this: No “No” means no go. EMAIL MAGIC: HOW NEVER TO BE IGNORED
AGAIN
There’s nothing more irritating than being ignored. Being
turned down is bad, but getting no response at all is the pits. It makes you feel invisible, as if you don’t exist. And it’s a
waste of your time. We’ve all been through it: You send an
email to someone you’re trying to do business with and they
ignore you. Then you send a polite follow-up and they
stonewall you again. So what do you do? You provoke a “No” with this one-sentence email. Have you given up on this project? The point is that this one-sentence email encapsulates the
best of “No”-oriented questions and plays on your
counterpart’s natural human aversion to loss.",
3693,Never split the difference,"The “No”
answer the email demands offers the other party the feeling
of safety and the illusion of control while encouraging them
to define their position and explain it to you. Just as important, it makes the implicit threat that you
will walk away on your own terms. To stop that from
happening—to cut their losses and prove their power—the
other party’s natural inclination is to reply immediately and
disagree. No, our priorities haven’t changed. We’ve just
gotten bogged down and . . . If you’re a parent, you already use this technique
instinctively. What do you do when your kids won’t leave
the house/park/mall? You say, “Fine. I’m leaving,” and you
begin to walk away. I’m going to guess that well over half
the time they yell, “No, wait!” and run to catch up. No one
likes to be abandoned. Now, this may seem like a rude way to address someone
in business, but you have to get over that.",
3694,Never split the difference,"It’s not rude, and
though it’s direct, it’s cloaked with the safety of “No.”
Ignoring you is what’s rude. I can tell you that I’ve used this
successfully not just in North America, but with people in
two different cultures (Arabic and Chinese) famous for
never saying “No.”
KEY LESSONS
Using this chapter’s tools in daily life is difficult for many
people because they go directly against one of society’s
biggest social dictums. That is, “Be nice.”
We’ve instrumentalized niceness as a way of greasing
the social wheels, yet it’s often a ruse. We’re polite and we
don’t disagree to get through daily existence with the least
degree of friction. But by turning niceness into a lubricant,
we’ve leeched it of meaning. A smile and a nod might
signify “Get me out of here!” as much as it means “Nice to
meet you.”
That’s death for a good negotiator, who gains their
power by understanding their counterpart’s situation and
extracting information about their counterpart’s desires and
needs.",
3695,Never split the difference,"Extracting that information means getting the other
party to feel safe and in control. And while it may sound
contradictory, the way to get there is by getting the other
party to disagree, to draw their own boundaries, to define
their desires as a function of what they do not want. As you try to put the chapter’s methods to use, I
encourage you to think of them as the anti–“niceness ruse.”
Not in the sense that they are unkind, but in the sense that
they are authentic. Triggering “No” peels away the plastic
falsehood of “Yes” and gets you to what’s really at stake. Along the way, keep in mind these powerful lessons:
■
Break the habit of attempting to get people to say
“yes.” Being pushed for “yes” makes people
defensive. Our love of hearing “yes” makes us
blind to the defensiveness we ourselves feel
when someone is pushing us to say it. ■
“No” is not a failure. We have learned that “No”
is the anti-“Yes” and therefore a word to be
avoided at all costs.",
3696,Never split the difference,"But it really often just means
“Wait” or “I’m not comfortable with that.” Learn
how to hear it calmly. It is not the end of the
negotiation, but the beginning. ■
“Yes” is the final goal of a negotiation, but don’t
aim for it at the start. Asking someone for “Yes”
too quickly in a conversation—“Do you like to
drink water, Mr. Smith?”—gets his guard up and
paints you as an untrustworthy salesman. ■
Saying “No” makes the speaker feel safe, secure,
and in control, so trigger it. By saying what they
don’t want, your counterpart defines their space
and gains the confidence and comfort to listen to
you.",
3697,Never split the difference,"That’s why “Is now a bad time to talk?” is
always better than “Do you have a few minutes
to talk?”
■
Sometimes the only way to get your counterpart
to listen and engage with you is by forcing them
into 
a 
“No.” 
That 
means 
intentionally
mislabeling one of their emotions or desires or
asking a ridiculous question—like, “It seems like
you want this project to fail”—that can only be
answered negatively. ■
Negotiate in their world. Persuasion is not about
how bright or smooth or forceful you are. It’s
about the other party convincing themselves that
the solution you want is their own idea. So don’t
beat them with logic or brute force. Ask them
questions that open paths to your goals. It’s not
about you. ■
If a potential business partner is ignoring you,
contact them with a clear and concise “No”-
oriented question that suggests that you are ready
to walk away. “Have you given up on this
project?” works wonders.",

TRIGGER THE TWO WORDS
THAT IMMEDIATELY
TRANSFORM ANY
NEGOTIATION
In August 2000, the militant Islamic group Abu Sayyaf, in
the southern Philippines, broadcast that it had captured a
CIA agent. The truth was not as newsworthy, or as valuable
to the rebels. Abu Sayyaf had kidnapped Jeffrey Schilling, a twenty-
four-year-old American who had traveled near their base in
Jolo Island. A California native, Schilling became a hostage
with a $10 million price tag on his head. At the time I was a Supervisory Special Agent (SSA)
attached to the FBI’s elite Crisis Negotiation Unit (CNU). The CNU is the equivalent of the special forces of
negotiations. It’s attached to the FBI’s Hostage Rescue
Team (HRT). Both are national counterterrorist response
assets. They are the best of the best. The CNU is based at the FBI Academy in Quantico,
Virginia.",
3699,Never split the difference,"The FBI Academy has come to be known by the
one word, “Quantico.” Rightly or wrongly, Quantico has
developed the reputation as one of the centers, if not the
center of knowledge, for law enforcement. When a
negotiation is going badly and the negotiators involved are
directed to call and find out what “Quantico” has to say, the
CNU is who they call. CNU developed what is a powerful staple in the high-
stakes world of crisis negotiation, the Behavioral Change
Stairway Model (BCSM). The model proposes five stages—
active listening, empathy, rapport, influence, and behavioral
change—that take any negotiator from listening to
influencing behavior. The origins of the model can be traced back to the great
American psychologist Carl Rogers, who proposed that real
change can only come when a therapist accepts the client as
he or she is—an approach known as unconditional positive
regard.",
3700,Never split the difference,"The vast majority of us, however, as Rogers
explained, come to expect that love, praise, and approval
are dependent on saying and doing the things people
(initially, our parents) consider correct. That is, because for
most of us the positive regard we experience is conditional,
we develop a habit of hiding who we really are and what we
really think, instead calibrating our words to gain approval
but disclosing little. Which is why so few social interactions lead to actual
behavior change. Consider the typical patient with severe
coronary heart disease recovering from open-heart surgery. The doctor tells the patient: “This surgery isn’t a cure. The
only way to truly prolong your life is to make the following
behavior changes . . .” The grateful patient responds: “Yes,
yes, yes, of course, Doctor! This is my second chance. I will
change!”
And do they?",
3701,Never split the difference,"Study after study has shown that, no,
nothing changes; two years after their operation, more than
90 percent of patients haven’t changed their lifestyle at all. Though the stakes of an everyday negotiation with your
child, boss, or client are usually not as high as that of a
hostage (or health crisis) negotiation, the psychological
environment necessary for not just temporary in-the-
moment compliance, but real gut-level change, is the same. If you successfully take someone up the Behavioral
Change Stairway, each stage attempting to engender more
trust and more connection, there will be a breakthrough
moment when unconditional positive regard is established
and you can begin exerting influence. After years of refining the BCSM and its tactics, I can
teach anyone how to get to that moment.",
3702,Never split the difference,"But as
cardiologists know all too well, and legions of B-school
grads weaned on the most famous negotiating book in the
world, Getting to Yes, have ultimately discovered, you more
than likely haven’t gotten there yet if what you’re hearing is
the word “yes.”
As you’ll soon learn, the sweetest two words in any
negotiation are actually “That’s right.”
CREATE A SUBTLE EPIPHANY
I was a natural for the Schilling case. I had spent some time
in the Philippines and had an extensive background in
terrorism from my New York City days assigned to the Joint
Terrorism Task Force (JTTF). A few days after Schilling became a hostage, my partner
Chuck Regini and I flew to Manila to run the negotiations. Along with Jim Nixon, the FBI’s highest official in Manila,
we conferred with top Philippine military brass. They agreed
to let us guide the negotiations. Then we got down to
business. One of us would take charge of the negotiation
strategy for the FBI and consequently for the U.S. government.",
3703,Never split the difference,"That became my role. With the support of my
colleagues, my job was to come up with the strategy, get it
approved, and implement it. As a result of the Schilling case, I would become the
FBI’s lead international kidnapping negotiator. Our principal adversary was Abu Sabaya, the rebel leader
who personally negotiated for Schilling’s ransom. Sabaya
was a veteran of the rebel movement with a violent past. He
was straight out of the movies, a terrorist-sociopath-killer. He had a history of rape, murder, and beheadings. He liked
to record his bloody deeds on video and send them to the
Philippine media. Sabaya always wore sunglasses, a bandana, a black T-
shirt, and camo pants. He thought it made him a more
dashing figure. If you look for any photos of Abu Sayyaf
terrorists from this period, you always see one in sunglasses. That’s Sabaya. Sabaya loved, loved, loved the media. He had the
Philippine reporters on speed dial. They’d call him and ask
him questions in Tagalog, his native tongue.",
3704,Never split the difference,"He would
answer in English because he wanted the world to hear his
voice on CNN. “They should make a movie about me,” he
would tell reporters. In my eyes, Sabaya was a cold-blooded businessman
with an ego as big as Texas. A real shark. Sabaya knew he
was in the commodities game. In Jeffrey Schilling, he had
an item of value. How much could he get for it? He would
find out, and I intended it to be a surprise he wouldn’t like. As an FBI agent, I wanted to free the hostage and bring the
criminal to justice. One crucial aspect of any negotiation is to figure out
how your adversary arrived at his position. Sabaya threw
out the $10 million ransom based on a business calculation. First, the United States was offering $5 million for
information leading to the arrest of any of the remaining
fugitives from the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Sabaya reasoned that if the United States would pay $5
million to get its hands on someone it didn’t like, it would
pay much more for a citizen.",
3705,Never split the difference,"Second, a rival faction of the Abu Sayyaf had just
reportedly been paid $20 million for six Western European
captives. Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi had made
the payment as “development aid.” This absurdity had been
compounded by a significant portion of the ransom being
paid in counterfeit bills. It was an opportunity for Gaddafi to
both embarrass Western governments and get money over-
the-table to groups with whom he sympathized. I’m sure he
laughed about that episode until the day he died. Regardless, a price had been set. Sabaya did the math
and figured Schilling was worth $10 million. Problem was,
Jeff Schilling came from a working-class family. His mother
could come up with $10,000, perhaps. The United States
wasn’t about to pay one dollar. But we would allow a
payment to be made if it could be run as a “sting” operation. If we could draw Sabaya into an offer-counteroffer
bargaining situation, we had a bargaining system that
worked every time.",
3706,Never split the difference,"We could beat him down to where we
wanted him, get the hostage out, and set up the “sting.”
For months Sabaya refused to budge. He argued that
Muslims in the Philippines had suffered five hundred years
of oppression, since Spanish missionaries had brought
Catholicism to the Philippines in the sixteenth century. He
recited instances where atrocities had been committed
against his Islamic forebears. He explained why the Abu
Sayyaf wanted to establish an Islamic state in the southern
Philippines. Fishing rights had been violated. You name it,
he thought it up and used it. Sabaya wanted $10 million in war damages—not
ransom, but war damages. He held firm in his demand and
kept us out of the offer-counteroffer system we wanted to
use against him. And he occasionally dropped in threats that he was
torturing Jeff Schilling. Sabaya negotiated directly with Benjie, a Filipino
military officer. They talked in Tagalog. We reviewed
transcripts translated to English and used them to advise
Benjie.",
3707,Never split the difference,"I rotated in and out of Manila and oversaw the talks
and strategy. I instructed Benjie to ask what Schilling had to
do with five hundred years of bad blood between Muslims
and Filipinos. He told Sabaya that $10 million was not
possible. No matter what approach we took to “reason” with
Sabaya over why Schilling had nothing to do with the “war
damages,” it fell on deaf ears. Our first “that’s right” breakthrough actually came when
I was negotiating with Benjie. He was a true Filipino patriot
and hero. He was the leader of the Philippine National
Police’s Special Action Force and had been in his share of
firefights. On many occasions, Benjie and his men had been
sent on rescue missions to save hostages, and they had a
sterling record. His men were feared, for good reason. They
rarely took handcuffs. Benjie wanted to take a hard line with Sabaya and speak
to him in direct, no-nonsense terms. We wanted to engage
Sabaya in dialogue to discover what made the adversary
tick.",
3708,Never split the difference,"We actually wanted to establish rapport with an
adversary. To Benjie that was distasteful. Benjie told us he needed a break. We had been working
him nearly twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week for
several weeks. He wanted to spend some time with his
family in the mountains north of Manila. We agreed, but
only on the condition that we could accompany him and
spend several hours both on Saturday and Sunday working
on negotiation strategy. That Saturday night we sat in the library of the American
ambassador’s summer residence working on the strategy. As
I was explaining to Benjie the value of establishing a
rapport-based, working relationship, even with an adversary
as dangerous as Sabaya, I could see a snarl coming over his
face. I realized I needed to negotiate with Benjie. “You hate Sabaya, don’t you?” I said, leading with a
label. Benjie unloaded on me. “I tell you I do!” he said. “He
has murdered and raped.",
3709,Never split the difference,"He has come up on our radio when
we were lobbing mortars on his position and said ‘these
mortars are music to my ears.’ I heard his voice come on
our radio one day and celebrate that he was standing over
the body of one of my men.”
This outburst was Benjie’s equivalent of “that’s right.”
As he acknowledged his rage, I watched him get control of
his anger and calm down. Though he had been very good
up to that point, from that moment forward Benjie became a
superstar. He blossomed into a truly talented negotiator. This “negotiation” between Benjie and me was no
different than any other negotiation between colleagues who
disagree on a strategy. Before you convince them to see
what you’re trying to accomplish, you have to say the things
to them that will get them to say, “That’s right.”
The “that’s right” breakthrough usually doesn’t come at
the beginning of a negotiation. It’s invisible to the
counterpart when it occurs, and they embrace what you’ve
said. To them, it’s a subtle epiphany.",
3710,Never split the difference,"TRIGGER A “THAT’S RIGHT!” WITH A SUMMARY
After four months of negotiations, Sabaya still refused to
budge. I decided it was time to hit the reset switch. Benjie 
had 
gotten 
so 
good 
at 
extending 
the
conversations that you could tell that there were times that
Sabaya must have paced back and forth for an hour before
calling Benjie, trying to figure out how to get what he
wanted. He would call in and say, “Tell me yes or no! Just
yes or no!”
We had to get Sabaya off this war damages nonsense. No matter what type of questioning, logic, or reasoning we
tried with him, he wouldn’t release it. Threats against
Schilling came and went. We talked him down each time. I decided that in order to break through this phase we
needed to reposition Sabaya with his own words in a way
that would dissolve barriers. We needed to get him to say,
“That’s right.” At the time, I didn’t know for sure what kind
of breakthrough it was going to give us. I just knew we
needed to trust the process.",
3711,Never split the difference,"I wrote a two-page document that instructed Benjie to
change course. We were going to use nearly every tactic in
the active listening arsenal:
1. Effective Pauses: Silence is powerful. We told
Benjie to use it for emphasis, to encourage
Sabaya to keep talking until eventually, like
clearing out a swamp, the emotions were drained
from the dialogue. 2. Minimal Encouragers: Besides silence, we
instructed using simple phrases, such as “Yes,”
“OK,” “Uh-huh,” or “I see,” to effectively
convey that Benjie was now paying full attention
to Sabaya and all he had to say. 3. Mirroring: Rather than argue with Sabaya and try
to separate Schilling from the “war damages,”
Benjie would listen and repeat back what Sabaya
said. 4. Labeling: Benjie should give Sabaya’s feelings a
name and identify with how he felt. “It all seems
so tragically unfair, I can now see why you
sound so angry.”
5. Paraphrase: Benjie should repeat what Sabaya is
saying back to him in Benjie’s own words.",
3712,Never split the difference,"This,
we told him, would powerfully show him you
really do understand and aren’t merely parroting
his concerns. 6. Summarize: A good summary is the combination
of rearticulating the meaning of what is said plus
the acknowledgment of the emotions underlying
that 
meaning 
(paraphrasing 
+ 
labeling 
=
summary). We told Benjie he needed to listen
and repeat the “world according to Abu Sabaya.”
He needed to fully and completely summarize all
the nonsense that Sabaya had come up with
about war damages and fishing rights and five
hundred years of oppression. And once he did
that fully and completely, the only possible
response for Sabaya, and anyone faced with a
good summary, would be “that’s right.”
Two days later Sabaya phoned Benjie. Sabaya spoke. Benjie listened. When he spoke, he followed my script: he
commiserated 
with 
the 
rebel 
group’s 
predicament.",
3713,Never split the difference,"Mirroring, encouraging, labeling, each tactic worked
seamlessly and cumulatively to soften Sabaya up and begin
shifting his perspective. Finally, Benjie repeated in his own
words Sabaya’s version of history and the emotions that
came with that version. Sabaya was silent for nearly a minute. Finally he spoke. “That’s right,” he said. We ended the call. The “war damages” demand just disappeared. From that point forward Sabaya never mentioned money
again. He never asked for another dime for the release of
Jeffrey Schilling. He ultimately became so weary of this
case and holding the young Californian that he let down his
guard. Schilling escaped from their camp, and Philippine
commandoes swooped in and rescued him. He returned
safely to his family in California. Two weeks after Jeff Schilling escaped, Sabaya called
Benjie:
“Have you been promoted yet?” he asked. “If not, you
should have been.”
“Why?” Benjie asked. “I was going to hurt Jeffrey,” Sabaya said.",
3714,Never split the difference,"“I don’t know
what you did to keep me from doing that, but whatever it
was, it worked.”
In June 2002 Sabaya was killed in a shoot-out with
Philippine military units. In the heat of negotiations for a man’s life, I didn’t
appreciate the value of those two words: “That’s right.” But
when I studied the transcripts and reconstructed the
trajectory of the negotiations, I realized that Sabaya had
changed course when he uttered those words. Benjie had
used some fundamental techniques that we had developed
over many years. He had reflected Sabaya’s vision. He had
stepped back from confrontation. He had allowed Sabaya to
speak freely and exhaust his version of events. “That’s right” signaled that negotiations could proceed
from deadlock. It broke down a barrier that was impeding
progress. It created a realization point with our adversary
where he actually agreed on a point without the feeling of
having given in. It was a stealth victory.",
3715,Never split the difference,"When your adversaries say, “That’s right,” they feel they
have assessed what you’ve said and pronounced it as
correct of their own free will. They embrace it. “That’s right” allowed us to draw out the talks and divert
Sabaya from hurting Schilling. And it gave Philippine
commandos time to mount their rescue operation. In hostage negotiations, we never tried to get to “yes” as
an endpoint. We knew that “yes” is nothing without “how.”
And when we applied hostage negotiating tactics to
business, we saw how “that’s right” often leads to the best
outcomes. “THAT’S RIGHT” IS GREAT, BUT IF “YOU’RE
RIGHT,” NOTHING CHANGES
Driving toward “that’s right” is a winning strategy in all
negotiations. But hearing “you’re right” is a disaster. Take my son, Brandon, and his development as a
football player. He had been playing on the offensive and
defensive lines all through high school. At six foot two and
250 pounds, he was formidable.",
3716,Never split the difference,"He loved to knock every
player wearing an opposing jersey to the ground. Having played quarterback, I didn’t fully appreciate the
blue-collar nature of being a lineman. Linemen are like
mountain goats. They put their heads down and hit things. It
makes them happy. At St. Thomas More prep school in Connecticut,
Brandon’s coach moved him to linebacker, and his role
suddenly changed from hitting everything he saw to
avoiding players who were trying to block him. He was
supposed to play off blocks—dodge them, if you will—and
get to the ball. But Brandon continued to confront opposing
blockers head-on, which kept him from getting to the
ballcarrier. His coach pleaded with him to avoid blockers,
but Brandon couldn’t change. He loved to hit. Flattening
opposing players was a source of pride. Both his coach and I kept trying to explain it to him. And every time we got the worst possible answer—“You’re
right.” He agreed, in theory, but he didn’t own the
conclusion.",
3717,Never split the difference,"Then he would go right back to the behavior we
were trying to get him to stop. He would smash blockers
and take himself out of the play. Why is “you’re right” the worst answer? Consider this: Whenever someone is bothering you, and
they just won’t let up, and they won’t listen to anything you
have to say, what do you tell them to get them to shut up
and go away? “You’re right.”
It works every time. Tell people “you’re right” and they
get a happy smile on their face and leave you alone for at
least twenty-four hours. But you haven’t agreed to their
position. You have used “you’re right” to get them to quit
bothering you. I was in the same situation with Brandon. He didn’t hear
me and embrace my request. What could I say to get
through to this kid? How could I reach Brandon and help
him change course? I thought back to Benjie and Sabaya. I took Brandon
aside before a crucial game.",
3718,Never split the difference,"I had searched my mind for a
way to hear the two critical words, “That’s right.”
“You seem to think it’s unmanly to dodge a block,” I
told him. “You think it’s cowardly to get out of someone’s
way that’s trying to hit you.”
Brandon stared at me and paused. “That’s right,” he said. With those words Brandon embraced the reality of what
was holding him back. Once he understood why he was
trying to knock down every blocker, he changed course. He
started avoiding the blocks and became an exceptionally
fine linebacker. With Brandon on the field tackling and playing star
linebacker, St. Thomas More School won every game. USING “THAT’S RIGHT” TO MAKE THE SALE
Getting to “that’s right” helped one of my students in her
job as a sales representative for a large pharmaceutical
company. She was trying to sell a new product to a doctor who
used similar medication. He was the largest user of this kind
of medication in her territory. The sale was critical to her
success.",
3719,Never split the difference,"In her first appointments, the doctor dismissed her
product. He said it was no better than the ones he was
already using. He was unfriendly. He didn’t even want to
hear her viewpoint. When she presented the positive
attributes of her product, he interrupted her and knocked
them down. Making the sales pitch, she soaked up as much as
possible about the doctor. She learned that he was
passionate about treating his patients. Each patient was
special in his eyes. Improving their sense of calm and peace
was the most important outcome for him. How could she put
her understanding of his needs, desires, and passions to
work for her? At her next visit, the doctor asked what medications she
wanted to discuss. Rather than tout the benefits of her
product, she talked about him and his practice. “Doctor,” she said, “the last time I was in we spoke
about your patients with this condition.",
3720,Never split the difference,"I remember thinking
that you seemed very passionate about treating them, and
how you worked hard to tailor the specific treatment to each
and every patient.”
He looked her in the eyes as if he were seeing her for the
first time. “That’s right,” he said. “I really feel like I’m treating an
epidemic that other doctors are not picking up on—which
means that a lot of patients are not getting treated
adequately.”
She told him he seemed to have a deep understanding of
how to treat these patients, especially because some of them
didn’t respond to the usual medications. They talked about
specific challenges he had confronted in treating his
patients. He gave her examples. When he was finished, she summarized what he had
said, especially the intricacies and problems in treatment. “You seem to tailor specific treatments and medications
for each patient,” she said. “That’s right,” he responded. This was the breakthrough she had hoped to reach. The
doctor had been skeptical and cold.",
3721,Never split the difference,"But when she
recognized his passion for his patients—using a summary—
the walls came down. He dropped his guard, and she was
able to gain his trust. Rather than pitch her product, she let
him describe his treatment and procedures. With this, she
learned how her medication would fit into his practice. She
then paraphrased what he said about the challenges of his
practice and reflected them back to him. Once the doctor signaled his trust and rapport, she could
tout the attributes of her product and describe precisely how
it would help him reach the outcomes he desired for his
patients. He listened intently. “It might be perfect for treating a patient who has not
benefited from the medication I have been prescribing,” he
told her. “Let me give yours a try.”
She made the sale. USING “THAT’S RIGHT” FOR CAREER SUCCESS
One of my Korean students got to “that’s right” in
negotiating with his ex-boss for a new job.",
3722,Never split the difference,"Returning to Seoul after getting his MBA, he wanted to
work in his company’s consumer electronics division, rather
than the semiconductor section, where he had been
stationed. He was a human resources specialist. Under the
company’s rules, he believed he had to remain in his
previous department, unless he could also get approval from
his ex-boss. He had gotten two job offers from the consumer
products division. He phoned his ex-boss from the United
States. “You should reject this offer and find your spot here
with the semiconductor division,” the ex-boss said. My student hung up depressed. If he wanted to advance
in the company, he had to obey his former superior. He
rejected the two offers and prepared to return to the
semiconductor side. Then he contacted a friend who was a senior manager in
the human resources department to check on the company’s
regulations. He found there was no rule that he had to stay
within his division, but he did need his ex-boss’s blessing to
switch.",
3723,Never split the difference,"He phoned his ex-boss again. This time he asked
questions to draw him out. “Is there any reason you want me to go to the
semiconductor headquarters?” he asked. “It’s the best position for you,” the ex-boss said. “The best position?” he asked. “It sounds like there’s no
regulation that I have to remain with the semiconductor
division,” he said. “Hmm,” the ex-boss said. “I don’t think
there is any.”
“Then will you please tell me what made you decide that
I remain in the semiconductor headquarters?” he asked. The ex-boss said he needed someone to help him
network at headquarters between the semiconductor and
consumer products divisions. “So it sounds like you could approve my new position
no matter which division, as long as I was in headquarters
and could help you communicate better with the top
managers.”
“That’s right,” he said. “I must admit I need your help in
headquarters.”
My student realized he had made a breakthrough.",
3724,Never split the difference,"Not
only had his ex-boss uttered those sweet words—“that’s
right”—but he had revealed his true motive: he needed an
ally in headquarters. “Is there any other help you need?” he asked. “Let me tell you everything,” the ex-boss responded. It turns out his former superior would be up for a
promotion to vice president in two years. He desperately
wanted to move up into this job. He needed someone in
headquarters to lobby the company CEO. “I would help you in any way,” my student said. “But I
could help with the networking and also talk you up to the
CEO even if I were at headquarters with the consumer
products division, right?”
“That’s right,” he said. “If you get an offer from the
consumer products unit, I will approve it.”
Bingo! By asking questions that got him to “that’s right,”
my student had achieved his goal.",
3725,Never split the difference,"He also got his boss to
reveal two “Black Swans,” the unspoken, underlying
breakthrough dynamics of a negotiation (explored in more
detail in Chapter 10):
■
His boss needed someone to help him network
and communicate in headquarters. ■
His boss would be up for a promotion and
needed someone to talk him up to the CEO. My student was able to win the job he desired on the
consumer electronics division. And he’s been talking up his
former boss. “I was stunned,” he wrote me in an email. “In this
culture it is not really possible to know what a superior is
thinking.”
I have many opportunities to travel the country and speak to
business leaders, either in formal speaking engagements or
private counseling sessions. I entertain them with war
stories, then I describe some basic negotiating skills. I
always impart a few techniques. Getting to “that’s right” is a
staple.",
3726,Never split the difference,"After a speech in Los Angeles, one of the attendees,
Emily, sent me an email:
Hi Chris, I feel compelled to tell you that I just tried
the “That’s right” technique in a price negotiation
with a potential new client. And, I got what I wanted. I’m so excited! Before I probably would have just gone with the
“in-the-middle” suggested price (halfway between
my initial offer and her initial counter). Instead, I
believe 
I 
correctly 
assessed 
her 
motivations,
presented her with the right statement to get to a
“that’s right” (in her mind) . . . and then she
proposed the solution I wanted and asked if I would
agree to it! So, I did of course. Thank you! Emily
And I thought to myself: That’s right. KEY LESSONS
“Sleeping in the same bed and dreaming different dreams”
is an old Chinese expression that describes the intimacy of
partnership (whether in marriage or in business) without the
communication necessary to sustain it. Such is the recipe for bad marriages and bad
negotiations.",
3727,Never split the difference,"With each party having its own set of objectives, its own
goals and motivations, the truth is that the conversational
niceties—the socially lubricating “yeses” and “you’re
rights” that get thrown out fast and furious early in any
interaction—are not in any way a substitute for real
understanding between you and your partner. The power of getting to that understanding, and not to
some simple “yes,” is revelatory in the art of negotiation. The moment you’ve convinced someone that you truly
understand her dreams and feelings (the whole world that
she inhabits), mental and behavioral change becomes
possible, and the foundation for a breakthrough has been
laid. Use these lessons to lay that foundation:
■
Creating unconditional positive regard opens the
door to changing thoughts and behaviors. Humans have an innate urge toward socially
constructive behavior.",
3728,Never split the difference,"The more a person feels
understood, and positively affirmed in that
understanding, the more likely that urge for
constructive behavior will take hold. ■
“That’s right” is better than “yes.” Strive for it. Reaching “that’s right” in a negotiation creates
breakthroughs. ■
Use a summary to trigger a “that’s right.” The
building blocks of a good summary are a label
combined 
with 
paraphrasing. Identify,
rearticulate, and emotionally affirm “the world
according to . . .”
CHAPTER 6
BEND THEIR REALITY
One Monday morning in Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, a
call came in to the FBI office from the nephew of a
prominent Haitian political figure. He spoke so fast he had
to repeat his story three times before I understood. But
finally I got the basics: kidnappers had snatched his aunt
from her car, and their ransom demand was $150,000.",
3729,Never split the difference,"“Give us the money,” the kidnappers told him, “or your
aunt is going to die.”
In the lawless, chaotic wake of the 2004 rebellion that
toppled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti surpassed
Colombia as the kidnap capital of the Americas. In fact, with
between eight and ten people abducted every day in the
Caribbean nation of eight million, Haiti earned the dubious
honor of having the highest kidnapping rate in the world. During this onslaught of abductions and death threats, I
was the FBI’s lead international kidnapping negotiator. And
I had never seen anything like it. Reports of abductions—
increasingly bold, daylight attacks right in Port-au-Prince—
seemed to roll into the office hourly: fourteen students
abducted on their school bus; American missionary Phillip
Snyder shot in an ambush and seized along with a Haitian
boy he was taking to Michigan for eye surgery; prominent
Haitian politicians and businessmen bundled from their
homes in broad daylight. No one was spared.",
3730,Never split the difference,"Most of the abductions went down the same way: ski-
mask-clad kidnappers surrounded a house or a car, forced
entry with a gun, and snatched a vulnerable victim—usually
a woman, child, or elderly person. Early on, there was the possibility that the kidnappings
were driven by politically aligned gangs seeking to
destabilize Haiti’s new government. This proved to be
wrong. Haitian criminals are famous for employing brutal
means for political ends, but when it came to kidnappings, it
was almost always all business. Later on, I’ll get to how we pieced together the clues to
discover who the perpetrators were and what they really
wanted—invaluable information when it came to negotiating
with and destabilizing these gangs. But first I want to
discuss the crystallizing feature of high-stakes, life-and-
death negotiating: that is, how little of it is on the surface.",
3731,Never split the difference,"When that Monday ransom call came in to the
politician’s nephew, the guy was so petrified he could only
think of doing one thing: paying the thugs. His reaction
makes sense: when you get a call from brutal criminals who
say they’ll kill your aunt unless you pay them immediately,
it seems impossible to find leverage in the situation. So you
pay the ransom and they release your relative, right? Wrong. There’s always leverage. Negotiation is never a
linear formula: add X to Y to get Z. We all have irrational
blind spots, hidden needs, and undeveloped notions. Once you understand that subterranean world of
unspoken needs and thoughts, you’ll discover a universe of
variables that can be leveraged to change your counterpart’s
needs and expectations.",
3732,Never split the difference,"From using some people’s fear of
deadlines and the mysterious power of odd numbers, to our
misunderstood relationship to fairness, there are always
ways to bend our counterpart’s reality so it conforms to
what we ultimately want to give them, not to what they
initially think they deserve. DON’T COMPROMISE
Let’s go back to the $150,000 ransom demand. We’re
always taught to look for the win-win solution, to
accommodate, to be reasonable. So what’s the win-win
here? What’s the compromise? The traditional negotiating
logic that’s drilled into us from an early age, the kind that
exalts compromises, says, “Let’s just split the difference and
offer them $75,000. Then everyone’s happy.”
No. Just, simply, no. The win-win mindset pushed by so
many negotiation experts is usually ineffective and often
disastrous. At best, it satisfies neither side. And if you
employ it with a counterpart who has a win-lose approach,
you’re setting yourself up to be swindled.",
3733,Never split the difference,"Of course, as we’ve noted previously, you need to keep
the cooperative, rapport-building, empathetic approach, the
kind that creates a dynamic in which deals can be made. But
you have to get rid of that naïveté. Because compromise
—“splitting the difference”—can lead to terrible outcomes. Compromise is often a “bad deal” and a key theme we’ll hit
in this chapter is that “no deal is better than a bad deal.”
Even in a kidnapping? Yes. A bad deal in a kidnapping is where someone pays
and no one comes out. To make my point on compromise, let me paint you an
example: A woman wants her husband to wear black shoes
with his suit. But her husband doesn’t want to; he prefers
brown shoes. So what do they do? They compromise, they
meet halfway. And, you guessed it, he wears one black and
one brown shoe. Is this the best outcome? No! In fact, that’s
t h e worst possible outcome. Either of the two other
outcomes—black or brown—would be better than the
compromise.",
3734,Never split the difference,"Next time you want to compromise, remind yourself of
those mismatched shoes. So why are we so infatuated with the notion of
compromise if it often leads to poor results? The real problem with compromise is that it has come to
be known as this great concept, in relationships and politics
and everything else. Compromise, we are told quite simply,
is a sacred moral good. Think back to the ransom demand: Fair is no ransom,
and what the nephew wants is to pay nothing. So why is he
going to offer $75,000, much less $150,000, for the
ransom? There is no validity in the $150,000 request. With
any compromise, the nephew ends up with a bizarrely bad
result. I’m here to call bullshit on compromise right now. We
don’t compromise because it’s right; we compromise
because it is easy and because it saves face. We compromise
in order to say that at least we got half the pie. Distilled to its
essence, we compromise to be safe.",
3735,Never split the difference,"Most people in a
negotiation are driven by fear or by the desire to avoid pain. Too few are driven by their actual goals. So don’t settle and—here’s a simple rule—never split the
difference. Creative solutions are almost always preceded by
some degree of risk, annoyance, confusion, and conflict. Accommodation and compromise produce none of that. You’ve got to embrace the hard stuff. That’s where the great
deals are. And that’s what great negotiators do. DEADLINES: MAKE TIME YOUR ALLY
Time is one of the most crucial variables in any negotiation. The simple passing of time and its sharper cousin, the
deadline, are the screw that pressures every deal to a
conclusion. Whether your deadline is real and absolute or merely a
line in the sand, it can trick you into believing that doing a
deal now is more important than getting a good deal.",
3736,Never split the difference,"Deadlines regularly make people say and do impulsive
things that are against their best interests, because we all
have a natural tendency to rush as a deadline approaches. What good negotiators do is force themselves to resist
this urge and take advantage of it in others. It’s not so easy. Ask yourself: What is it about a deadline that causes
pressure and anxiety? The answer is consequences; the
perception of the loss we’ll incur in the future—“The deal is
off!” our mind screams at us in some imaginary future
scenario—should no resolution be achieved by a certain
point in time. When you allow the variable of time to trigger such
thinking, you have taken yourself hostage, creating an
environment of reactive behaviors and poor choices, where
your counterpart can now kick back and let an imaginary
deadline, and your reaction to it, do all the work for him.",
3737,Never split the difference,"Yes, I used the word “imaginary.” In all the years I’ve
been doing work in the private sector, I’ve made it a point to
ask nearly every entrepreneur and executive I’ve worked
with whether, over the course of their entire careers, they
have ever been a witness to or a party of a negotiation in
which a missed deadline had negative repercussions. Among hundreds of such clients, there’s one single, solitary
gentleman who gave the question serious consideration and
responded affirmatively. Deadlines are often arbitrary,
almost always flexible, and hardly ever trigger the
consequences we think—or are told—they will. Deadlines are the bogeymen of negotiation, almost
exclusively self-inflicted figments of our imagination,
unnecessarily unsettling us for no good reason.",
3738,Never split the difference,"The mantra
we coach our clients on is, “No deal is better than a bad
deal.” If that mantra can truly be internalized, and clients
begin to believe they’ve got all the time they need to
conduct the negotiation right, their patience becomes a
formidable weapon. A few weeks after the Haitian kidnapping boom began, we
started to notice two patterns. First, Mondays seemed to be
especially busy, as if the kidnappers had a particularly
strong work ethic and wanted to get a jump on the week. And, second, the thugs grew increasingly eager to get paid
as the weekend approached. At first, this didn’t make any sense. But by listening
closely to the kidnappers and debriefing the hostages we
rescued, we discovered something that should have been
obvious: These crimes weren’t politically motivated at all. Instead, these guys were garden-variety thugs who wanted
to get paid by Friday so they could party through the
weekend.",
3739,Never split the difference,"Once we understood the pattern and knew the
kidnappers’ self-imposed deadline, we had two key pieces
of information that totally shifted the leverage to our side. First, if we let the pressure build by stalling the
negotiations until Thursday or Friday, we could cut the best
deal. And, second, because you didn’t need anything close
to $150,000 to have a good weekend in Haiti, offering a lot,
lot less would suffice. How close we were getting to their self-imposed
deadline would be indicated by how specific the threats
were that they issued. “Give us the money or your aunt is
going to die” is an early stage threat, as the time isn’t
specified. Increasing specificity on threats in any type of
negotiations indicates getting closer to real consequences at
a real specified time. To gauge the level of a particular
threat, we’d pay attention to how many of the four questions
—What? Who? When? And how?—were addressed.",
3740,Never split the difference,"When
people issue threats, they consciously or subconsciously
create ambiguities and loopholes they fully intend to exploit. As the loopholes started to close as the week progressed,
and did so over and over again in similar ways with
different kidnappings, the pattern emerged. With this information in hand, I came to expect the
kidnappings to be orderly, four-day events. It didn’t make
the abductions any more pleasant for the victim, but it
certainly made them more predictable—and a whole lot
cheaper—for the families on the other end. It’s not just with hostage negotiations that deadlines can
play into your hands. Car dealers are prone to give you the
best price near the end of the month, when their transactions
are assessed. And corporate salespeople work on a quarterly
basis and are most vulnerable as the quarter comes to a
close. Now, knowing how negotiators use their counterpart’s
deadlines to gain leverage would seem to suggest that it’s
best to keep your own deadlines secret.",
3741,Never split the difference,"And that’s the
advice you’ll get from most old-school negotiation experts. In his bestselling 1980 book, You Can Negotiate
Anything,1 negotiation expert Herb Cohen tells the story of
his first big business deal, when his company sent him to
Japan to negotiate with a supplier. When he arrived, his counterparts asked him how long
he was staying, and Cohen said a week. For the next seven
days, his hosts proceeded to entertain him with parties,
tours, and outings—everything but negotiation. In fact,
Cohen’s counterparts didn’t start serious talks until he was
about to leave, and the two sides hammered out the deal’s
final details in the car to the airport. Cohen landed in the United States with the sinking
feeling that he’d been played, and that he had conceded too
much under deadline pressure. Would he have told them his
deadline in retrospect?",
3742,Never split the difference,"No, Cohen says, because it gave
them a tool he didn’t have: “They knew my deadline, but I
didn’t know theirs.”
That mentality is everywhere these days. Seeing a simple
rule to follow and assuming that a deadline is a strategic
weakness, most negotiators follow Cohen’s advice and hide
their drop-dead date. Allow me to let you in on a little secret: Cohen, and the
herd of negotiation “experts” who follow his lead, are
wrong. Deadlines cut both ways. Cohen may well have been
nervous about what his boss would say if he left Japan
without an agreement. But it’s also true that Cohen’s
counterparts wouldn’t have won if he’d left without a deal. That’s the key: When the negotiation is over for one side,
it’s over for the other too. In fact, Don A. Moore, a professor at the Haas School of
Business at the University of California, Berkeley, says that
hiding a deadline actually puts the negotiator in the worst
possible position.",
3743,Never split the difference,"In his research, he’s found that hiding
your deadlines dramatically increases the risk of an impasse. That’s because having a deadline pushes you to speed up
your concessions, but the other side, thinking that it has
time, will just hold out for more. Imagine if when NBA owners set a lockout deadline
during contract negotiations they didn’t tell the players’
union. They would concede and concede as the deadline
approached, inciting the union to keep negotiating past the
secret deadline. In that sense, hiding a deadline means
you’re negotiating with yourself, and you always lose when
you do so. Moore discovered that when negotiators tell their
counterparts about their deadline, they get better deals. It’s
true. First, by revealing your cutoff you reduce the risk of
impasse. And second, when an opponent knows your
deadline, he’ll get to the real deal- and concession-making
more quickly. I’ve got one final point to make before we move on:
Deadlines are almost never ironclad.",
3744,Never split the difference,"What’s more important
is engaging in the process and having a feel for how long
that will take. You may see that you have more to
accomplish than time will actually allow before the clock
runs out. NO SUCH THING AS FAIR
In the third week of my negotiations class, we play my
favorite type of game, that is, the kind that shows my
students how much they don’t understand themselves (I
know—I’m cruel). It’s called the Ultimatum Game, and it goes like this:
After the students split into pairs of a “proposer” and an
“accepter,” I give each proposer $10. The proposer then has
to offer the accepter a round number of dollars. If the
accepter agrees he or she receives what’s been offered and
the proposer gets the rest. If the accepter refuses the offer,
though, they both get nothing and the $10 goes back to me. Whether they “win” and keep the money or “lose” and
have to give it back is irrelevant (except to my wallet). What’s important is the offer they make.",
3745,Never split the difference,"The truly shocking
thing is that, almost without exception, whatever selection
anyone makes, they find themselves in a minority. No
matter whether they chose $6/$4, $5/$5, $7/$3, $8/$2, etc.,
they look around and are inevitably surprised to find no split
was chosen far more than any other. In something as simple
as merely splitting $10 of “found” money, there is no
consensus of what constitutes a “fair” or “rational” split. After we run this little experiment, I stand up in front of
the class and make a point they don’t like to hear: the
reasoning each and every student used was 100 percent
irrational and emotional. “What?” they say. “I made a rational decision.”
Then I lay out how they’re wrong. First, how could they
all be using reason if so many have made different offers? That’s the point: They didn’t. They assumed the other guy
would reason just like them. “If you approach a negotiation
thinking that the other guy thinks like you, you’re wrong,” I
say.",
3746,Never split the difference,"“That’s not empathy; that’s projection.”
And then I push it even further: Why, I ask, did none of
the proposers offer $1, which is the best rational offer for
them and logically unrejectable for the accepter? And if they
did and they got rejected—which happens—why did the
accepter turn them down? “Anyone who made any offer other than $1 made an
emotional choice” I say. “And for you accepters who turned
down $1, since when is getting $0 better than getting $1? Did the rules of finance suddenly change?”
This rocks my students’ view of themselves as rational
actors. But they’re not. None of us are. We’re all irrational,
all emotional. Emotion is a necessary element to decision
making that we ignore at our own peril. Realizing that hits
people hard between the eyes. In Descartes’ Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human
Brain,2 neuroscientist Antonio Damasio explained a
groundbreaking discovery he made.",
3747,Never split the difference,"Studying people who
had damage in the part of the brain where emotions are
generated, he found that they all had something peculiar in
common: They couldn’t make decisions. They could
describe what they should do in logical terms, but they
found it impossible to make even the simplest choice. In other words, while we may use logic to reason
ourselves toward a decision, the actual decision making is
governed by emotion. THE F-WORD: WHY IT’S SO POWERFUL, WHEN TO
USE IT, AND HOW
The most powerful word in negotiations is “Fair.” As human
beings, we’re mightily swayed by how much we feel we
have been respected. People comply with agreements if they
feel they’ve been treated fairly and lash out if they don’t. A decade of brain-imaging studies has shown that
human neural activity, particularly in the emotion-regulating
insular cortex, reflects the degree of unfairness in social
interactions. Even nonhuman primates are hardwired to
reject unfairness.",
3748,Never split the difference,"In one famous study, two capuchin
monkeys were set to perform the same task, but one was
rewarded with sweet grapes while the other received
cucumbers. In response to such blatant unfairness, the
cucumber-fed monkey literally went bananas. In the Ultimatum Game, years of experience has shown
me that most accepters will invariably reject any offer that is
less than half of the proposer’s money. Once you get to a
quarter of the proposer’s money you can forget it and the
accepters are insulted. Most people make an irrational
choice to let the dollar slip through their fingers rather than
to accept a derisory offer, because the negative emotional
value of unfairness outweighs the positive rational value of
the money. This irrational reaction to unfairness extends all the way
to serious economic deals. Remember Robin Williams’s great work as the voice of
the genie in Disney’s Aladdin?",
3749,Never split the difference,"Because he wanted to leave
something wonderful behind for his kids, he said, he did the
voice for a cut-rate fee of $75,000, far below his usual $8
million payday. But then something happened: the movie
became a huge hit, raking in $504 million. And Williams went ballistic. Now look at this with the Ultimatum Game in mind. Williams wasn’t angry because of the money; it was the
perceived unfairness that pissed him off. He didn’t complain
about his contract until Aladdin became a blockbuster, and
then he and his agent went loud and long about how they
got ripped off. Lucky for Williams, Disney wanted to keep its star
happy. After initially pointing out the obvious—that he’d
happily signed the deal—Disney made the dramatic gesture
of sending the star a Picasso painting worth a reported $1
million. The nation of Iran was not so lucky.",
3750,Never split the difference,"In recent years, Iran has put up with sanctions that have
cost it well over $100 billion in foreign investment and oil
revenue in order to defend a uranium-enriching nuclear
program that can only meet 2 percent of its energy needs. In
other words, like the students who won’t take a free $1
because the offer seems insulting, Iran has screwed itself out
of its chief source of income—oil and gas revenue—in order
to pursue an energy project with little expected payoff. Why? Again, fairness. For Iran, it’s not fair that the global powers—which
together have several thousand nuclear weapons—should be
able to decide if it can use nuclear energy. And why, Iran
wonders, is it considered a pariah for enriching uranium
when India and Pakistan, which clandestinely acquired
nuclear weapons, are accepted members of the international
community? In a TV interview, former Iranian nuclear negotiator
Seyed Hossein Mousavian hit the nail on the head.",
