3751,Never split the difference,"“The
nuclear issue today for Iranians is not nuclear,” he said, “it’s
defending their integrity [as an] independent identity against
the pressure of the rest.”
You may not trust Iran, but its moves are pretty clear
evidence that rejecting perceived unfairness, even at
substantial cost, is a powerful motivation. Once you understand what a messy, emotional, and
destructive dynamic “fairness” can be, you can see why
“Fair” is a tremendously powerful word that you need to use
with care. In fact, of the three ways that people drop this F-bomb,
only one is positive. The most common use is a judo-like defensive move that
destabilizes the other side. This manipulation usually takes
the form of something like, “We just want what’s fair.”
Think back to the last time someone made this implicit
accusation of unfairness to you, and I bet you’ll have to
admit that it immediately triggered feelings of defensiveness
and discomfort.",
3752,Never split the difference,"These feelings are often subconscious and
often lead to an irrational concession. A friend of mine was selling her Boston home in a bust
market a few years back. The offer she got was much lower
than she wanted—it meant a big loss for her—and out of
frustration she dropped this F-bomb on the prospective
buyer. “We just want what’s fair,” she said. Emotionally rattled by the implicit accusation, the guy
raised his offer immediately. If you’re on the business end of this accusation, you
need to realize that the other side might not be trying to pick
your 
pocket; 
like my friend, they might just be
overwhelmed by circumstance. The best response either
way is to take a deep breath and restrain your desire to
concede. Then say, “Okay, I apologize. Let’s stop
everything and go back to where I started treating you
unfairly and we’ll fix it.”
The second use of the F-bomb is more nefarious.",
3753,Never split the difference,"In this
one, your counterpart will basically accuse you of being
dense or dishonest by saying, “We’ve given you a fair
offer.” It’s a terrible little jab meant to distract your attention
and manipulate you into giving in. Whenever someone tries this on me, I think back to the
last NFL lockout. Negotiations were getting down to the wire and the NFL
Players Association (NFLPA) said that before they agreed to
a final deal they wanted the owners to open their books. The
owners’ answer? “We’ve given the players a fair offer.”
Notice the horrible genius of this: instead of opening
their books or declining to do so, the owners shifted the
focus to the NFLPA’s supposed lack of understanding of
fairness. If you find yourself in this situation, the best reaction is
to simply mirror the “F” that has just been lobbed at you. “Fair?” you’d respond, pausing to let the word’s power do
to them as it was intended to do to you.",
3754,Never split the difference,"Follow that with a
label: “It seems like you’re ready to provide the evidence
that supports that,” which alludes to opening their books or
otherwise handing over information that will either
contradict their claim to fairness or give you more data to
work with than you had previously. Right away, you declaw
the attack. The last use of the F-word is my favorite because it’s
positive and constructive. It sets the stage for honest and
empathetic negotiation. Here’s how I use it: Early on in a negotiation, I say, “I
want you to feel like you are being treated fairly at all times. So please stop me at any time if you feel I’m being unfair,
and we’ll address it.”
It’s simple and clear and sets me up as an honest dealer. With that statement, I let people know it is okay to use that
word with me if they use it honestly. As a negotiator, you
should strive for a reputation of being fair. Your reputation
precedes you. Let it precede you in a way that paves
success.",
3755,Never split the difference,"HOW TO DISCOVER THE EMOTIONAL DRIVERS
BEHIND WHAT THE OTHER PARTY VALUES
A few years ago, I stumbled upon the book How to Become
a Rainmaker,3 and I like to review it occasionally to refresh
my sense of the emotional drivers that fuel decisions. The
book does a great job to explain the sales job not as a
rational argument, but as an emotional framing job. If you can get the other party to reveal their problems,
pain, and unmet objectives—if you can get at what people
are really buying—then you can sell them a vision of their
problem that leaves your proposal as the perfect solution. Look at this from the most basic level. What does a good
babysitter sell, really? It’s not child care exactly, but a
relaxed evening. A furnace salesperson? Cozy rooms for
family time. A locksmith? A feeling of security. Know the emotional drivers and you can frame the
benefits of any deal in language that will resonate.",
3756,Never split the difference,"BEND THEIR REALITY
Take the same person, change one or two variables, and
$100 can be a glorious victory or a vicious insult. Recognizing this phenomenon lets you bend reality from
insult to victory. Let me give you an example. I have this coffee mug, red
and white with the Swiss flag. No chips, but used. What
would you pay for it, deep down in your heart of hearts? You’re probably going to say something like $3.50. Let’s say it’s your mug now. You’re going to sell it to
me. So tell me what it’s worth. You’re probably going to say something between $5 and
$7. In both cases, it was the exact same mug. All I did was
move the mug in relation to you, and I totally changed its
value. Or imagine that I offer you $20 to run a three-minute
errand and get me a cup of coffee. You’re going to think to
yourself that $20 for three minutes is $400 an hour. You’re
going to be thrilled. What if then you find out that by getting you to run that
errand I made a million dollars.",
3757,Never split the difference,"You’d go from being
ecstatic for making $400 an hour to being angry because
you got ripped off. The value of the $20, just like the value of the coffee
mug, didn’t change. But your perspective of it did. Just by
how I position the $20, I can make you happy or disgusted
by it. I tell you that not to expose our decision making as
emotional and irrational. We’ve already seen that. What I
am saying is that while our decisions may be largely
irrational, that doesn’t mean there aren’t consistent patterns,
principles, and rules behind how we act. And once you
know those mental patterns, you start to see ways to
influence them. By far the best theory for describing the principles of our
irrational decisions is something called Prospect Theory. Created in 1979 by the psychologists Daniel Kahneman and
Amos Tversky, prospect theory describes how people
choose between options that involve risk, like in a
negotiation.",
3758,Never split the difference,"The theory argues that people are drawn to sure
things over probabilities, even when the probability is a
better choice. That’s called the Certainty Effect. And people
will take greater risks to avoid losses than to achieve gains. That’s called Loss Aversion. That’s why people who statistically have no need for
insurance buy it. Or consider this: a person who’s told he
has a 95 percent chance of receiving $10,000 or a 100
percent chance of getting $9,499 will usually avoid risk and
take the 100 percent certain safe choice, while the same
person who’s told he has a 95 percent chance of losing
$10,000 or a 100 percent chance of losing $9,499 will make
the opposite choice, risking the bigger 95 percent option to
avoid the loss. The chance for loss incites more risk than the
possibility of an equal gain. Over the next few pages I’ll explain a few prospect
theory tactics you can use to your advantage.",
3759,Never split the difference,"But first let me
leave you with a crucial lesson about loss aversion: In a
tough negotiation, it’s not enough to show the other party
that you can deliver the thing they want. To get real leverage, you have to persuade them that
they have something concrete to lose if the deal falls
through. 1. ANCHOR THEIR EMOTIONS
To bend your counterpart’s reality, you have to start with
the basics of empathy. So start out with an accusation audit
acknowledging all of their fears. By anchoring their
emotions in preparation for a loss, you inflame the other
side’s loss aversion so that they’ll jump at the chance to
avoid it. On my first consulting project after leaving the FBI, I
received the honor to train the national hostage negotiation
team for the United Arab Emirates. Unfortunately, the
prestige of the assignment was tempered during the project
by problems with the general contractor (I was a
subcontractor).",
3760,Never split the difference,"The problems became so bad that I was
going to have to go back to the contractors I’d signed up,
who normally got $2,000 a day, and tell them that for
several months, I could only offer $500. I knew exactly what they would do if I just told them
straight out: they’d laugh me out of town. So I got each of
them on the phone and hit them hard with an accusation
audit. “I got a lousy proposition for you,” I said, and paused
until each asked me to go on. “By the time we get off the
phone, you’re going to think I’m a lousy businessman. You’re going to think I can’t budget or plan. You’re going
to think Chris Voss is a big talker. His first big project ever
out of the FBI, he screws it up completely. He doesn’t know
how to run an operation. And he might even have lied to
me.”
And then, once I’d anchored their emotions in a
minefield of low expectations, I played on their loss
aversion. “Still, I wanted to bring this opportunity to you before I
took it to someone else,” I said.",
3761,Never split the difference,"Suddenly, their call wasn’t about being cut from $2,000
to $500 but how not to lose $500 to some other guy. Every single one of them took the deal. No
counteroffers, no complaints. Now, if I hadn’t anchored
their emotions low, their perception of $500 would have
been totally different. If I’d just called and said, “I can give
you $500 per day. What do you think?” they’d have taken it
as an insult and slammed down the phone. 2. LET THE OTHER GUY GO FIRST . . . MOST OF
THE TIME. Now, it’s clear that the benefits of anchoring emotions are
great when it comes to bending your counterpart’s reality. But going first is not necessarily the best thing when it
comes to negotiating price. When the famous film director Billy Wilder went to hire
the famous detective novelist Raymond Chandler to write
the 1944 classic Double Indemnity, Chandler was new to
Hollywood.",
3762,Never split the difference,"But he came ready to negotiate, and in his
meeting with Wilder and the movie’s producer, Chandler
made the first salary offer: he bluffly demanded $150 per
week and warned Wilder that it might take him three weeks
to finish the project. Wilder and the producer could barely stop from
laughing, because they had been planning to pay Chandler
$750 per week and they knew that movie scripts took
months to write. Lucky for Chandler, Wilder and the
producer valued their relationship with Chandler more than
a few hundred dollars, so they took pity on him and called
an agent to represent Chandler in the negotiations. Similarly, I had a student named Jerry who royally
screwed up his salary negotiation by going first (let me say
that this happened before he was my student). In an interview at a New York financial firm, he
demanded $110,000, in large part because it represented a
30 percent raise.",
3763,Never split the difference,"It was only after he started that he realized
that the firm had started everybody else in his program at
$125,000. That’s why I suggest you let the other side anchor
monetary negotiations. The real issue is that neither side has perfect information
going to the table. This often means you don’t know enough
to open with confidence. That’s especially true anytime you
don’t know the market value of what you are buying or
selling, like with Jerry or Chandler. By letting them anchor you also might get lucky: I’ve
experienced many negotiations when the other party’s first
offer was higher than the closing figure I had in mind. If I’d
gone first they would have agreed and I would have left
with either the winner’s curse or buyer’s remorse, those gut-
wrenching feelings that you’ve overpaid or undersold. That said, you’ve got to be careful when you let the
other guy anchor. You have to prepare yourself psychically
to withstand the first offer.",
3764,Never split the difference,"If the other guy’s a pro, a shark,
he’s going to go for an extreme anchor in order to bend
your reality. Then, when they come back with a merely
absurd offer it will seem reasonable, just like an expensive
$400 iPhone seems reasonable after they mark it down from
a crazy $600. The tendency to be anchored by extreme numbers is a
psychological quirk known as the “anchor and adjustment”
effect. Researchers have discovered that we tend to make
adjustments from our first reference points. For example,
most people glimpsing 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 estimate
that it yields a higher result than the same string in reverse
order. That’s because we focus on the first numbers and
extrapolate. That’s not to say, “Never open.” Rules like that are easy
to remember, but, like most simplistic approaches, they are
not always good advice. If you’re dealing with a rookie
counterpart, you might be tempted to be the shark and throw
out an extreme anchor.",
3765,Never split the difference,"Or if you really know the market
and you’re dealing with an equally informed pro, you might
offer a number just to make the negotiation go faster. Here’s my personal advice on whether or not you want
to be the shark that eats a rookie counterpart. Just
remember, your reputation precedes you. I’ve run into
CEOs whose reputation was to always badly beat their
counterpart and pretty soon no one would deal with them. 3. ESTABLISH A RANGE
While going first rarely helps, there is one way to seem to
make an offer and bend their reality in the process. That is,
by alluding to a range. What I mean is this: When confronted with naming your
terms or price, counter by recalling a similar deal which
establishes your “ballpark,” albeit the best possible ballpark
you wish to be in.",
3766,Never split the difference,"Instead of saying, “I’m worth $110,000,”
Jerry might have said, “At top places like X Corp., people in
this job get between $130,000 and $170,000.”
That gets your point across without moving the other
party into a defensive position. And it gets him thinking at
higher levels. Research shows that people who hear extreme
anchors unconsciously adjust their expectations in the
direction of the opening number. Many even go directly to
their price limit. If Jerry had given this range, the firm
probably would have offered $130,000 because it looked so
cheap next to $170,000. In a recent study,4 Columbia Business School
psychologists found that job applicants who named a range
received significantly higher overall salaries than those who
offered a number, especially if their range was a “bolstering
range,” in which the low number in the range was what they
actually wanted. Understand, if you offer a range (and it’s a good idea to
do so) expect them to come in at the low end. 4.",
3767,Never split the difference,"PIVOT TO NONMONETARY TERMS
People get hung up on “How much?” But don’t deal with
numbers in isolation. That leads to bargaining, a series of
rigid positions defined by emotional views of fairness and
pride. Negotiation is a more intricate and subtle dynamic
than that. One of the easiest ways to bend your counterpart’s
reality to your point of view is by pivoting to nonmonetary
terms. After you’ve anchored them high, you can make
your offer seem reasonable by offering things that aren’t
important to you but could be important to them. Or if their
offer is low you could ask for things that matter more to you
than them. Since this is sometimes difficult, what we often
do is throw out examples to start the brainstorming process. Not long ago I did some training for the Memphis Bar
Association. Normally, for the training they were looking
for, I’d charge $25,000 a day. They came in with a much
lower offer that I balked at.",
3768,Never split the difference,"They then offered to do a cover
story about me in their association magazine. For me to be
on the cover of a magazine that went out to who knows how
many of the country’s top lawyers was priceless advertising. (Plus my mom is really proud of it!)
They had to put something on the cover anyway, so it
had zero cost to them and I gave them a steep discount on
my fee. I constantly use that as an example in my
negotiations now when I name a price. I want to stimulate
my counterpart’s brainstorming to see what valuable
nonmonetary gems they might have that are cheap to them
but valuable to me. 5. WHEN YOU DO TALK NUMBERS, USE ODD ONES
Every number has a psychological significance that goes
beyond its value. And I’m not just talking about how you
love 17 because you think it’s lucky. What I mean is that, in
terms 
of 
negotiation, 
some 
numbers 
appear 
more
immovable than others.",
3769,Never split the difference,"The biggest thing to remember is that numbers that end
in 
0 
inevitably 
feel 
like 
temporary 
placeholders,
guesstimates that you can easily be negotiated off of. But
anything you throw out that sounds less rounded—say,
$37,263—feels like a figure that you came to as a result of
thoughtful calculation. Such numbers feel serious and
permanent to your counterpart, so use them to fortify your
offers. 6. SURPRISE WITH A GIFT
You can get your counterpart into a mood of generosity by
staking an extreme anchor and then, after their inevitable
first rejection, offering them a wholly unrelated surprise gift. Unexpected conciliatory gestures like this are hugely
effective because they introduce a dynamic called
reciprocity; the other party feels the need to answer your
generosity in kind. They will suddenly come up on their
offer, or they’ll look to repay your kindness in the future. People feel obliged to repay debts of kindness. Let’s look at it in terms of international politics.",
3770,Never split the difference,"In 1977
Egyptian president Anwar Sadat dramatically pushed
negotiations on the Egypt-Israel peace treaty forward by
making a surprise address to the Israeli Knesset, a generous
gesture that did not involve making any actual concessions
but did signify a big step toward peace. Back in Haiti, a few hours after the kidnappers had snatched
his aunt, I was on the phone with the politician’s nephew. There was no way their family could come up with
$150,000, he told me, but they could pay between $50,000
and $85,000. But since learning that the ransom was just
party money, I was aiming much lower: $5,000. We were
not going to compromise. It was a matter of professional
pride. I advised him to start off by anchoring the conversation
in the idea that he didn’t have the money, but to do so
without saying “No” so as not to hit their pride head-on. “How am I supposed to do that?” he asked in the next
call. The kidnapper made another general threat against the
aunt and again demanded the cash.",
3771,Never split the difference,"That’s when I had the nephew subtly question the
kidnapper’s fairness. “I’m sorry,” the nephew responded, “but how are we
supposed to pay if you’re going to hurt her?”
That brought up the aunt’s death, which was the thing
the kidnappers most wanted to avoid. They needed to keep
her unharmed if they hoped to get any money. They were
commodity traders, after all. Notice that to this point the nephew hadn’t named a
price. This game of attrition finally pushed the kidnappers to
name a number first. Without prodding, they dropped to
$50,000. Now that the kidnappers’ reality had been bent to a
smaller number, my colleagues and I told the nephew to
stand his ground. “How can I come up with that kind of money?” we told
him to ask. Again, the kidnapper dropped his demand, to $25,000. Now that we had him in our sights, we had the nephew
make his first offer, an extreme low anchor of $3,000. The line went silent and the nephew began to sweat
profusely, but we told him to hold tight.",
3772,Never split the difference,"This always
happened at the moment the kidnapper’s economic reality
got totally rearranged. When he spoke again, the kidnapper seemed shell-
shocked. But he went on. His next offer was lower,
$10,000. Then we had the nephew answer with a strange
number that seemed to come from deep calculation of what
his aunt’s life was worth: $4,751. His new price? $7,500. In response, we had the cousin
“spontaneously” say he’d throw in a new portable CD stereo
and repeated the $4,751. The kidnappers, who didn’t really
want the CD stereo felt there was no more money to be had,
said yes. Six hours later, the family paid that sum and the aunt
came back home safely. HOW TO NEGOTIATE A BETTER SALARY
One of the critical factors in business school rankings is how
well their graduates are compensated. So I tell every MBA
class I lecture that my first objective is to single-handedly
raise the ranking of their school by teaching them how to
negotiate a better salary.",
3773,Never split the difference,"I break down the process into three parts that blend this
chapter’s dynamics in a way that not only brings you better
money, but convinces your boss to fight to get it for you. BE PLEASANTLY PERSISTENT ON NONSALARY
TERMS
Pleasant persistence is a kind of emotional anchoring that
creates empathy with the boss and builds the right
psychological environment for constructive discussion. And
the more you talk about nonsalary terms, the more likely
you are to hear the full range of their options. If they can’t
meet your nonsalary requests, they may even counter with
more money, like they did with a French-born American
former student of mine. She kept asking—with a big smile—
for an extra week of vacation beyond what the company
normally gave. She was “French,” she said, and that’s what
French people did.",
3774,Never split the difference,"The hiring company was completely
handcuffed on the vacation issue, but because she was so
darned 
delightful, 
and 
because 
she 
introduced 
a
nonmonetary variable into the notion of her value, they
countered by increasing her salary offer. SALARY TERMS WITHOUT SUCCESS TERMS IS
RUSSIAN ROULETTE
Once you’ve negotiated a salary, make sure to define
success for your position—as well as metrics for your next
raise. That’s meaningful for you and free for your boss,
much like giving me a magazine cover story was for the bar
association. It gets you a planned raise and, by defining
your success in relation to your boss’s supervision, it leads
into the next step . . . SPARK THEIR INTEREST IN YOUR SUCCESS AND
GAIN AN UNOFFICIAL MENTOR
Remember the idea of figuring what the other side is really
buying?",
3775,Never split the difference,"Well, when you are selling yourself to a manager,
sell yourself as more than a body for a job; sell yourself, and
your success, as a way they can validate their own
intelligence and broadcast it to the rest of the company. Make sure they know you’ll act as a flesh-and-blood
argument for their importance. Once you’ve bent their
reality to include you as their ambassador, they’ll have a
stake in your success. Ask: “What does it take to be successful here?”
Please notice that this question is similar to questions that
are suggested by many MBA career counseling centers, yet
not exactly the same. And it’s the exact wording of this
question that’s critical. Students from my MBA courses who have asked this
question in job interviews have actually had interviewers
lean forward and say, “No one ever asked us that before.”
The interviewer then gave a great and detailed answer. The key issue here is if someone gives you guidance,
they will watch to see if you follow their advice.",
3776,Never split the difference,"They will
have a personal stake in seeing you succeed. You’ve just
recruited your first unofficial mentor. To show how this can be done to near perfection, I can
think of no better example than my former MBA student
Angel Prado. While Angel was finishing up his MBA, he went to his
boss and began to lay the groundwork for his work post-
MBA (which the company was paying). During his last
semester, he set a nonspecific anchor—a kind of range—by
suggesting to his boss that once he graduated and the
company was done investing in his MBA (around $31,000
per year), that money should go to him as salary. His boss made no commitment, but Angel was
pleasantly persistent about it, which set the idea as an
anchor in his boss’s mind. Upon graduation, Angel and his boss had their big sit-
down. In an assertive and calm manner, Angel broached a
nonfinancial issue to move the focus away from “How
much?”: he asked for a new title.",
3777,Never split the difference,"Angel’s boss readily agreed that a new role was a no-
brainer after Angel’s new degree. At that point, Angel and his manager defined what his
roles and responsibilities would be in his new role, thereby
setting success metrics. Then Angel took a breath and
paused so that his boss would be the first to throw out a
number. At last, he did. Curiously enough, the number
showed that Angel’s earlier efforts at anchoring had worked:
he proposed to add $31,000 to Angel’s base salary, almost a
50 percent raise. But Angel was no rookie negotiator, not after taking my
class. So instead of countering and getting stuck in “How
much?” he kept talking, labeling the boss’s emotions and
empathizing with his situation (at the time the company was
going through difficult negotiations with its investors). And then Angel courteously asked for a moment to step
away and print up the agreed-upon job description.",
3778,Never split the difference,"This
pause created a dynamic of pre-deadline urgency in his
boss, which Angel exploited when he returned with the
printout. On 
the 
bottom, 
he’d 
added 
his 
desired
compensation: “$134.5k—$143k.”
In that one little move, Angel weaved together a bunch
of the lessons from this chapter. The odd numbers gave
them the weight of thoughtful calculation. The numbers
were high too, which exploited his boss’s natural tendency
to go directly to his price limit when faced by an extreme
anchor. And they were a range, which made Angel seem
less aggressive and the lower end more reasonable in
comparison. From his boss’s body language—raised eyebrows—it
was clear that he was surprised by the compensation
request. But it had the desired effect: after some comments
about the description, he countered with $120,000. Angel didn’t say “No” or “Yes,” but kept talking and
creating empathy. Then, in the middle of a sentence,
seemingly out of the blue, his boss threw out $127,000.",
3779,Never split the difference,"With his boss obviously negotiating with himself, Angel
kept him going. Finally his boss said he agreed with the
$134,500 and would pay that salary starting in three
months, contingent on the board of directors’ approval. As the icing on the cake, Angel worked in a positive use
of the word “Fair” (“That’s fair,” he said), and then sold the
raise to his boss as a marriage in which his boss would be
the mentor. “I’m asking you, not the board, for the
promotion, and all I need is for you to agree with it,” he
said. And how did Angel’s boss reply to his new ambassador? “I’ll fight to get you this salary.”
So follow Angel’s lead and make it rain! KEY LESSONS
Compared to the tools discussed in previous chapters, the
techniques here seem concrete and easy to use. But many
people 
shy 
away 
from 
them 
because 
they 
seem
manipulative. Something that bends your counterpart’s
reality must be cheating, right?",
3780,Never split the difference,"In response, let me just say that these tools are used by
all the best negotiators because they simply recognize the
human psyche as it is. We are emotional, irrational beasts
who are emotional and irrational in predictable, pattern-
filled ways. Using that knowledge is only, well, rational. As you work these tools into your daily life, remember
the following powerful lessons:
■
All negotiations are defined by a network of
subterranean desires and needs. Don’t let
yourself be fooled by the surface. Once you
know that the Haitian kidnappers just want party
money, you will be miles better prepared. ■
Splitting the difference is wearing one black and
one brown shoe, so don’t compromise. Meeting
halfway often leads to bad deals for both sides. ■
Approaching deadlines entice people to rush the
negotiating process and do impulsive things that
are against their best interests.",
3781,Never split the difference,"■
The F-word—“Fair”—is an emotional term
people usually exploit to put the other side on the
defensive and gain concessions. When your
counterpart 
drops 
the 
F-bomb, 
don’t 
get
suckered into a concession. Instead, ask them to
explain how you’re mistreating them. ■
You can bend your counterpart’s reality by
anchoring his starting point. Before you make an
offer, emotionally anchor them by saying how
bad it will be. When you get to numbers, set an
extreme anchor to make your “real” offer seem
reasonable, or use a range to seem less
aggressive. The real value of anything depends
on what vantage point you’re looking at it from. ■
People will take more risks to avoid a loss than
to realize a gain. Make sure your counterpart
sees that there is something to lose by inaction. CHAPTER 7
CREATE THE ILLUSION OF
CONTROL
A month after I’d finished working the case of Jeffrey
Schilling in May 2001, I got orders from headquarters to
head back to Manila.",
3782,Never split the difference,"The same bad guys who’d taken
Schilling, a brutal group of radical Islamists named the Abu
Sayyaf, had raided the Dos Palmas private diving resort and
taken twenty hostages, including three Americans: Martin
and Gracia Burnham, a missionary couple from Wichita,
Kansas; and Guillermo Sobero, a guy who ran a California
waterproofing firm. Dos Palmas was a negotiator’s nightmare from the start. The day after the kidnappings, the recently elected
Philippine president, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, set up the
most confrontational, nonconstructive dynamic possible by
publicly declaring “all-out war” on the Abu Sayyaf. Not exactly empathetic discourse, right? It got a lot worse. The Philippine army and marines had a turf war in the
midst of the negotiations, pissing off the kidnappers with
several botched raids. Because American hostages were
involved, the CIA, the FBI, and U.S. military intelligence
were all called in and we too squabbled among ourselves.",
3783,Never split the difference,"Then the kidnappers raped and killed several hostages, 9/11
happened, and the Abu Sayyaf was linked to Al Qaeda. By the time the crisis concluded in an orgy of gunshots
in June 2002, Dos Palmas had officially become the biggest
failure in my professional life. To call it a train wreck would
be generous, if you know what I mean. But failures plant the seeds of future success, and our
failure in the Philippines was no exception. If the Dos Palmas calamity showed me anything, it was
that we all were still suffering under the notion that
negotiation was a wrestling match where the point is to
exhaust your opponent into submission, hope for the best,
and never back down.",
3784,Never split the difference,"As my disappointment with Dos Palmas forced me to
reckon with our failed techniques, I took a deep look into
the newest negotiating theories—some great and some
completely harebrained—and I had a chance encounter with
a case in Pittsburgh that completely changed how I looked
at the interpersonal dynamics of negotiation conversations. From the ashes of Dos Palmas, then, we learned a lesson
that would forever change how the FBI negotiated
kidnappings. We learned that negotiation was coaxing, not
overcoming; co-opting, not defeating. Most important, we
learned that successful negotiation involved getting your
counterpart to do the work for you and suggest your
solution himself. It involved giving him the illusion of
control while you, in fact, were the one defining the
conversation. The tool we developed is something I call the calibrated,
or open-ended, question. What it does is remove aggression
from conversations by acknowledging the other side openly,
without resistance.",
3785,Never split the difference,"In doing so, it lets you introduce ideas
and requests without sounding pushy. It allows you to
nudge. I’ll explain it in depth later on, but for now let me say
that it’s really as simple as removing the hostility from the
statement “You can’t leave” and turning it into a question. “What do you hope to achieve by going?”
DON’T TRY TO NEGOTIATE IN A FIREFIGHT
The moment I arrived in Manila on the Burnham-Sobero
case I was sent down to the Mindanao region, where the
Philippine military was lobbing bullets and rockets into a
hospital complex where the Abu Sayyaf and the hostages
were holed up. This was no place for a negotiator, because it’s
impossible to have a dialogue in the middle of a firefight. Then things got worse: when I woke up the next morning, I
learned that during the night the kidnappers had taken their
hostages and escaped.",
3786,Never split the difference,"The “escape” was the first sign that this operation was
going to be a rolling train wreck and that the Philippine
military was less than a trustworthy partner. During debriefings following the episode, it was
revealed that during a cease-fire a military guy had collected
a suitcase from the thugs in the hospital, and not long after
that all the soldiers on the rear perimeter of the hospital had
been called away for a “meeting.” Coincidentally—or not—
the bad guys chose that moment to slip away. Things really blew up two weeks later, on the
Philippines’ 
Independence 
Day, 
when Abu 
Sabaya
announced that he was going to behead “one of the whites”
unless the government called off its manhunt by midday. We knew this meant one of the Americans and anticipated it
would be Guillermo Sobero.",
3787,Never split the difference,"We didn’t have any direct contact with the kidnappers at
the time because our partners in the Philippine military had
assigned us an intermediary who always “forgot” to make
sure we were present for his phone calls with the kidnappers
(and similarly “forgot” to tape them). All we could do was
send text messages offering to schedule a time to speak. What ended up happening was that just before the noon
deadline, Sabaya and a member of the Philippine
presidential cabinet had a conversation on a radio talk show,
and the government conceded to Sabaya’s demand to name
a Malaysian senator as a negotiator. In exchange, Sabaya
agreed not to kill a hostage. But it was too late to fix this atmosphere of
confrontation, distrust, and lies. That afternoon, the hostages
heard Sabaya on the phone yelling, “But that was part of the
agreement! That was a part of the agreement!” Not long
after, the Abu Sayyaf beheaded Guillermo Sobero and for
good measure the group took fifteen more hostages.",
3788,Never split the difference,"With none of the important moving parts anywhere near
under our control and the United States largely uninterested
in spite of Sobero’s murder, I headed back to Washington,
D.C. It seemed like there was little we could do. Then 9/11 changed everything. Once a minor terrorist outfit, the Abu Sayyaf was
suddenly linked to Al Qaeda. And then a Philippine TV
reporter named Arlyn dela Cruz got into the Abu Sayyaf
camp and videotaped Sabaya as he taunted the American
missionaries Martin and Gracia Burnham, who were so
emaciated they looked like concentration camp survivors. The video hit the U.S. news media like thunder. Suddenly,
the case became a major U.S. government priority. THERE IS ALWAYS A TEAM ON THE OTHER SIDE
The FBI sent me back in. Now I was sent in to make sure a
deal got made. It was all very high profile, too. Some of my
contacts reported that FBI director Robert Mueller was
personally briefing President George W. Bush every
morning on what we were doing.",
3789,Never split the difference,"When Director Mueller
showed up in the U.S. Embassy in Manila and I was
introduced to him, a look of recognition came over his face. That was a very heady moment. But all the support in the world won’t work if your
counterpart’s team is dysfunctional. If your negotiation
efforts don’t reach past your counterpart and into the team
behind him, then you’ve got a “hope”-based deal—and
hope is not a strategy. One of the things I failed to fully appreciate then was
that the kidnappers had changed negotiators themselves. Sabaya had been replaced. My boss Gary Noesner had, in a previous kidnapping,
pointed out to me that a change in negotiators by the other
side almost always signaled that they meant to take a harder
line. What I didn’t realize at the time was this meant Sabaya
was going to play a role as a deal breaker if he wasn’t
accounted for. Our new tack was to buy the Burnhams back.",
3790,Never split the difference,"Although
the United States officially doesn’t pay ransoms, a donor
had been found who would provide $300,000. The new
Abu Sayyaf negotiator agreed to a release. The ransom drop was a disaster. The kidnappers decided
that they wouldn’t release the Burnhams: or, rather, Sabaya,
who was physically in charge of the hostages, refused to
release them. He had cut his own side-deal—one we didn’t
know about—and it had fallen through. The new negotiator,
now embarrassed and in a foul mood, covered himself by
claiming that the payment was short $600. We were baffled
—“Six hundred dollars? You won’t let hostages go because
of six hundred dollars?”—and we tried to argue that if the
money was missing, it must have been the courier who had
stolen the money. But we had no dynamic of trust and
cooperation to back us up. The $300,000 was gone and we
were back to rarely answered text messages.",
3791,Never split the difference,"The slow-motion wreck culminated about two months
later with a botched “rescue.” A team of Philippine Scout
Rangers walking around in the woods came across the Abu
Sayyaf camp, or so they said. Later we heard another
government agency had tipped them off. That other
government agency (OGA) had not told us about their
location because . . . because . . . why? That’s something I
will never understand. The Scout Rangers formed a skirmish line from a tree
line above the camp and opened fire, indiscriminately
pouring bullets into the area. Gracia and Martin were taking
a nap in their hammocks when the fire started raining down. They both fell out of their hammocks and started to roll
down the hill toward safety. But as a sheet of bullets from
their rescuers fell on them, Gracia felt a searing burn flare
through her right thigh. And then, she felt Martin go limp.",
3792,Never split the difference,"Minutes later, after the last rebels fled, the squad of
Philippine soldiers tried to reassure Gracia that her husband
was fine, but she shook her head. After a year in captivity,
she had no time for fantasies. Gracia knew her husband was
dead, and she was right: he’d been hit in the chest, three
times, by “friendly” fire. In the end, the supposed rescue mission killed two of the
three hostages there that day (a Philippine nurse named
Ediborah Yap also died), and the big fish—Sabaya—
escaped to live a few more months. From beginning to end,
the thirteen-month mission was a complete failure, a waste
of lives and treasure. As I sat in the dark at home a few days
later, dispirited and spent, I knew that something had to
change. We couldn’t let this happen again. If the hostages’ deaths were going to mean something,
we would have to find a new way to negotiate,
communicate, listen, and speak, both with our enemies and
with our friends. Not for communication’s sake, though. No.",
3793,Never split the difference,"We had to do it to win. AVOID A SHOWDOWN
No two ways about it, my return to the United States was a
time of reckoning. I questioned—I even doubted—some of
what we were doing at the FBI. If what we knew wasn’t
enough, we had to get better. The real kick in the pants came after my return, when I
was reviewing information about the case, a lot of which we
hadn’t had in the field. Among the piles of information was
one fact that totally blew my mind. Martin Burnham had been overheard on a phone call to
someone. I wondered what in God’s name our hostage was
doing talking on the phone without us knowing. And with
whom was he talking? There’s only one reason a hostage
ever gets on a phone. It’s to provide proof of life. Someone
else had been trying to ransom the Burnhams out. It turned out to be someone working for a crooked
Philippine politician who’d been running a parallel
negotiation for the Burnhams’ release.",
3794,Never split the difference,"He wanted to buy the
hostages out himself in order to show up Philippine
president Arroyo. But it wasn’t so much that this guy was going behind our
backs that bothered me. As is pretty clear already, there
were a whole lot of underhanded things going on. What
really ate at me was that this schmuck, who wasn’t an FBI-
trained hostage negotiator, had pulled off something that I
hadn’t been able to. He’d gotten to speak to Martin Burnham on the phone. For free. That’s when I realized that this crooked pol’s success
where we had failed was a kind of metaphor for everything
that was wrong with our one-dimensional mindset. Beyond our problems with the Philippine military, the
big reason we had no effective influence with the
kidnappers and hostages was that we had this very tit-for-tat
mentality. Under that mentality, if we called up the bad guys
we were asking for something, and if they gave it to us we
had to give them something back.",
3795,Never split the difference,"And so, because we were
positive that the Burnhams were alive, we’d never bothered
to call and ask for proof of life. We were afraid to go into
debt. If we made an “ask” and they granted it, we’d owe. Not
making good on a debt risked the accusation of bad-faith
negotiation and bad faith in kidnappings gets people killed. And of course we didn’t ask the kidnappers to talk
directly to the hostage because we knew they’d say “no”
and we were afraid of being embarrassed. That fear was a major flaw in our negotiating mindset. There is some information that you can only get through
direct, extended interactions with your counterpart. We also needed new ways to get things without asking
for them. We needed to finesse making an “ask” with
something more sophisticated than closed-ended questions
with their yes-no dynamic. That’s when I realized that what we had been doing
wasn’t communication; it was verbal flexing. We wanted
them to see things our way and they wanted us to see it their
way.",
3796,Never split the difference,"If you let this dynamic loose in the real world,
negotiation breaks down and tensions flare. That whole
ethos permeated everything the FBI was doing. Everything
was a showdown. And it didn’t work. Our approach to proof-of-life questions embodied all
these problems. At the time, we proved that our hostages were alive by
devising questions that asked for a piece of information only
the hostage could know. Computer-security-style questions,
like, “What’s the name of Martin’s first dog?” or “What’s
Martin’s dad’s middle name?”
This particular type of question had many failings,
however. For one thing, it had sort of become a signature of
law enforcement in the kidnapping world. When a family
starts asking a question of that type, it’s a near certainty that
the cops are coaching them. And that makes kidnappers
very nervous. Even beyond the nerves, you had the problem that
answering questions like those required little, if any, effort.",
3797,Never split the difference,"The bad guys go and get the fact and give it to you right
away, because it’s so easy. Bang, bang, bang! It happens so
fast that you didn’t gain any tactical advantage, any usable
information, any effort on their part toward a goal that
serves you. And all negotiation, done well, should be an
information-gathering process that vests your counterpart in
an outcome that serves you. Worst of all, the bad guys know that they have just given
you something—a proof of life—which triggers this whole
human reciprocity gene. Whether we like to recognize it or
not, a universal rule of human nature, across all cultures, is
that when somebody gives you something, they expect
something in return. And they won’t give anything else until
you pay them back. Now, we didn’t want to trigger this whole reciprocity
thing because we didn’t want to give anything. So what
happened?",
3798,Never split the difference,"All of our conversations became these paralyzed
confrontations between two parties who wanted to extract
something from each other but didn’t want to give. We
didn’t communicate, out of pride and fear. That’s why we failed, while numbskulls like this crooked
Philippine politician just stumbled in and got what we so
desperately needed. That is, communication without
reciprocity. I sat back and wondered to myself, How the hell
do we do that? SUSPEND UNBELIEF
While I was racking my brains over how this sleazy
politician managed to get Martin Burnham on the phone
while we never could, FBI Pittsburgh had a kidnapping
case. My partner Chuck brought me the tapes from the case
because he thought it was funny. You see, one Pittsburgh
drug dealer had kidnapped the girlfriend of another
Pittsburgh drug dealer, and for whatever reason the victim
drug dealer came to the FBI for help.",
3799,Never split the difference,"Coming to the FBI
seemed kind of contrary to his best interests, being a drug
dealer and all, but he did it because no matter who you are,
when you need help you go to the FBI. Right? On the tapes, our hostage negotiators are riding around
with this drug dealer while he’s negotiating with the other
drug dealer. Normally we would have had the guy ask a
bulletproof proof-of-life question, like, “What was the name
of the girlfriend’s teddy bear when she was little?” But in
this situation, this drug dealer hadn’t yet been coached on
asking a “correct” question. So in the middle of the
conversation with the kidnapper, he just blurts, “Hey, dog,
how do I know she’s all right?”
And the funniest thing happened. The kidnapper actually
went silent for ten seconds. He was completely taken aback.",
3800,Never split the difference,"Then he said, in a much less confrontational tone of voice,
“Well, I’ll put her on the phone.” I was floored because this
unsophisticated drug dealer just pulled off a phenomenal
victory in the negotiation. To get the kidnapper to volunteer
to put the victim on the phone is massively huge. That’s when I had my “Holy shit!” moment and realized
that this is the technique I’d been waiting for. Instead of
asking some closed-ended question with a single correct
answer, he’d asked an open-ended, yet calibrated one that
forced the other guy to pause and actually think about how
to solve the problem. I thought to myself, This is perfect! It’s a natural and normal question, not a request for a fact. It’s a “how” question, and “how” engages because “how”
asks for help. Best of all, he doesn’t owe the kidnapper a damn thing. The guy volunteers to put the girlfriend on the phone: he
thinks it’s his idea. The guy who just offered to put the
girlfriend on the line thinks he’s in control.",
3801,Never split the difference,"And the secret to
gaining the upper hand in a negotiation is giving the other
side the illusion of control. The genius of this technique is really well explained by
something that the psychologist Kevin Dutton says in his
book Split-Second Persuasion.1 He talks about what he
calls “unbelief,” which is active resistance to what the other
side is saying, complete rejection. That’s where the two
parties in a negotiation usually start. If you don’t ever get off that dynamic, you end up
having showdowns, as each side tries to impose its point of
view. You get two hard skulls banging against each other,
like in Dos Palmas. But if you can get the other side to drop
their unbelief, you can slowly work them to your point of
view on the back of their energy, just like the drug dealer’s
question got the kidnapper to volunteer to do what the drug
dealer wanted. You don’t directly persuade them to see your
ideas. Instead, you ride them to your ideas.",
3802,Never split the difference,"As the saying
goes, the best way to ride a horse is in the direction in which
it is going. Our job as persuaders is easier than we think. It’s not to
get others believing what we say. It’s just to stop them
unbelieving. Once we achieve that, the game’s half-won. “Unbelief is the friction that keeps persuasion in check,”
Dutton says. “Without it, there’d be no limits.”
Giving your counterpart the illusion of control by asking
calibrated questions—by asking for help—is one of the most
powerful tools for suspending unbelief. Not long ago, I read
this great article in the New York Times2 by a medical
student who was faced with a patient who had ripped out his
IV, packed his bags, and was making a move to leave
because his biopsy results were days late and he was tired of
waiting. Just then a senior physician arrived.",
3803,Never split the difference,"After calmly
offering the patient a glass of water and asking if they could
chat for a minute, he said he understood why the patient was
pissed off and promised to call the lab to see why the results
were delayed. But what he did next is what really suspended the
patient’s unbelief: he asked a calibrated question—what he
felt was so important about leaving—and then when the
patient said he had errands to handle, the doctor offered to
connect the patient with services that could help him get
them done. And, boom, the patient volunteered to stay. What’s so powerful about the senior doctor’s technique
is that he took what was a showdown—“I’m going to leave”
versus “You can’t leave”—and asked questions that led the
patient to solve his own problem . . . in the way the doctor
wanted. It was still a kind of showdown, of course, but the doctor
took the confrontation and bravado out of it by giving the
patient the illusion of control.",
3804,Never split the difference,"As an old Washington Post
editor named Robert Estabrook once said, “He who has
learned to disagree without being disagreeable has
discovered the most valuable secret of negotiation.”
This same technique for suspending unbelief that you
use with kidnappers and escaping patients works for
anything, even negotiating prices. When you go into a store,
instead of telling the salesclerk what you “need,” you can
describe what you’re looking for and ask for suggestions. Then, once you’ve picked out what you want, instead of
hitting them with a hard offer, you can just say the price is a
bit more than you budgeted and ask for help with one of the
greatest-of-all-time calibrated questions: “How am I
supposed to do that?” The critical part of this approach is
that you really are asking for help and your delivery must
convey that. With this negotiating scheme, instead of
bullying the clerk, you’re asking for their advice and giving
them the illusion of control.",
3805,Never split the difference,"Asking for help in this manner, after you’ve already
been engaged in a dialogue, is an incredibly powerful
negotiating technique for transforming encounters from
confrontational showdowns into joint problem-solving
sessions. And calibrated questions are the best tool. CALIBRATE YOUR QUESTIONS
A few years ago, I was consulting with a client who had a
small firm that did public relations for a large corporation. The folks at the big company were not paying their bills,
and as time went on, they owed my client more and more
money. They kept her on the hook by promising lots of
repeat business, implying that she would get a pile of
revenue if she just kept working. She felt trapped. My advice for her was simple: I told her to engage them
in a conversation where she summarized the situation and
then asked, “How am I supposed to do that?”
She shook her head. No way. The idea of having to ask
this question just terrified her. “If they tell me I have to, then
I’m trapped!” was her reaction.",
3806,Never split the difference,"She also heard the question as “You’re screwing me out
of money and it has to stop.” That sounded like the first step
to her getting fired as a consultant. I explained to her that this implication, though real, was
in her mind. Her client would hear the words and not the
implication as long as she kept calm and avoided making it
sound by her delivery like an accusation or threat. As long
as she stayed cool, they would hear it as a problem to be
solved. She didn’t quite believe me. We walked through the
script several times, but she was still afraid. Then a few days
later she called me, totally giddy with happiness. The client
had called with another request and she had finally gotten
up the courage to summarize the situation, and ask, “How
am I supposed to do that?”
And you know what?",
3807,Never split the difference,"The answer she got was “You’re
right, you can’t and I apologize.” Her client explained that
they were going through some internal problems, but she
was given a new accounting contact and told she’d be paid
within forty-eight hours. And she was. Now, think about how my client’s question worked:
without accusing them of anything, it pushed the big
company to understand her problem and offer the solution
she wanted. That in a nutshell is the whole point of open-
ended questions that are calibrated for a specific effect. Like the softening words and phrases “perhaps,”
“maybe,” “I think,” and “it seems,” the calibrated open-
ended question takes the aggression out of a confrontational
statement or close-ended request that might otherwise anger
your counterpart. What makes them work is that they are
subject to interpretation by your counterpart instead of being
rigidly defined. They allow you to introduce ideas and
requests without sounding overbearing or pushy.",
3808,Never split the difference,"And that’s the difference between “You’re screwing me
out of money, and it has to stop” and “How am I supposed
to do that?”
The real beauty of calibrated questions is the fact that
they offer no target for attack like statements do. Calibrated
questions have the power to educate your counterpart on
what the problem is rather than causing conflict by telling
them what the problem is. But calibrated questions are not just random requests for
comment. They have a direction: once you figure out where
you want a conversation to go, you have to design the
questions that will ease the conversation in that direction
while letting the other guy think it’s his choice to take you
there. That’s why I refer to these questions as calibrated
questions. You have to calibrate them carefully, just like
you would calibrate a gun sight or a measuring scale, to
target a specific problem. The good news is that there are rules for that.",
3809,Never split the difference,"First off, calibrated questions avoid verbs or words like
“can,” “is,” “are,” “do,” or “does.” These are closed-ended
questions that can be answered with a simple “yes” or a
“no.” Instead, they start with a list of words people know as
reporter’s questions: “who,” “what,” “when,” “where,”
“why,” and “how.” Those words inspire your counterpart to
think and then speak expansively. But let me cut the list even further: it’s best to start with
“what,” 
“how,” 
and sometimes “why.” Nothing else. “Who,” “when,” and “where” will often just get your
counterpart to share a fact without thinking. And “why” can
backfire. Regardless of what language the word “why” is
translated into, it’s accusatory. There are very rare moments
when this is to your advantage. The only time you can use “why” successfully is when
the defensiveness that is created supports the change you
are trying to get them to see.",
3810,Never split the difference,"“Why would you ever change
from the way you’ve always done things and try my
approach?” is an example. “Why would your company ever
change from your long-standing vendor and choose our
company?” is another. As always, tone of voice, respectful
and deferential, is critical. Otherwise, treat “why” like a burner on a hot stove—
don’t touch it. Having just two words to start with might not seem like a
lot of ammunition, but trust me, you can use “what” and
“how” to calibrate nearly any question. “Does this look like
something you would like?” can become “How does this
look to you?” or “What about this works for you?” You can
even ask, “What about this doesn’t work for you?” and
you’ll probably trigger quite a bit of useful information from
your counterpart. Even something as harsh as “Why did you do it?” can be
calibrated to “What caused you to do it?” which takes away
the emotion and makes the question less accusatory.",
3811,Never split the difference,"You should use calibrated questions early and often, and
there are a few that you will find that you will use in the
beginning of nearly every negotiation. “What is the biggest
challenge you face?” is one of those questions. It just gets
the other side to teach you something about themselves,
which is critical to any negotiation because all negotiation is
an information-gathering process. Here are some other great standbys that I use in almost
every negotiation, depending on the situation:
■
What about this is important to you? ■
How can I help to make this better for us? ■
How would you like me to proceed? ■
What is it that brought us into this situation? ■
How can we solve this problem? ■
What’s the objective? / What are we trying to
accomplish here? ■
How am I supposed to do that? The implication of any well-designed calibrated question
is that you want what the other guy wants but you need his
intelligence to overcome the problem.",
3812,Never split the difference,"This really appeals to
very aggressive or egotistical counterparts. You’ve not only implicitly asked for help—triggering
goodwill and less defensiveness—but you’ve engineered a
situation in which your formerly recalcitrant counterpart is
now using his mental and emotional resources to overcome
your challenges. It is the first step in your counterpart
internalizing your way—and the obstacles in it—as his own. And that guides the other party toward designing a solution. Your solution. Think back to how the doctor used calibrated questions
to get his patient to stay. As his story showed, the key to
getting people to see things your way is not to confront
them on their ideas (“You can’t leave”) but to acknowledge
their ideas openly (“I understand why you’re pissed off”)
and then guide them toward solving the problem (“What do
you hope to accomplish by leaving?”). Like I said before, the secret to gaining the upper hand
in a negotiation is giving the other side the illusion of
control.",
3813,Never split the difference,"That’s why calibrated questions are ingenious:
Calibrated questions make your counterpart feel like they’re
in charge, but it’s really you who are framing the
conversation. Your counterpart will have no idea how
constrained they are by your questions. Once I was negotiating with one of my FBI bosses about
attending a Harvard executive program. He had already
approved the expenditure for the travel, but on the day
before I was supposed to leave he called me into his office
and began to question the validity of the trip. I knew him well enough to know that he was trying to
show me that he was in charge. So after we talked for a
while, I looked at him and asked, “When you originally
approved this trip, what did you have in mind?”
He visibly relaxed as he sat back in his chair and
brought the top of his fingers and thumbs together in the
shape of a steeple. Generally this is a body language that
means the person feels superior and in charge.",
3814,Never split the difference,"“Listen,” he said, “just make sure you brief everyone
when you get back.”
That question, calibrated to acknowledge his power and
nudge him toward explaining himself, gave him the illusion
of control. And it got me just what I wanted. HOW NOT TO GET PAID
Let’s pause for a minute here, because there’s one vitally
important thing you have to remember when you enter a
negotiation armed with your list of calibrated questions. That is, all of this is great, but there’s a rub: without self-
control and emotional regulation, it doesn’t work. The very first thing I talk about when I’m training new
negotiators is the critical importance of self-control. If you
can’t control your own emotions, how can you expect to
influence the emotions of another party? To show you what I mean, let me tell you a story. Not long ago, a freelance marketing strategist came to
me with a problem.",
3815,Never split the difference,"One of her clients had hired a new CEO,
a penny pincher whose strategy was to cut costs by
offshoring everything he could. He was also a male
chauvinist who didn’t like the assertive style in which the
strategist, a woman, conducted herself. Immediately my client and the CEO started to go at each
other on conference calls in that passive-aggressive way that
is ever present in corporate America. After a few weeks of
this, my client decided she’d had enough and invoiced the
CEO for the last bit of work she’d done (about $7,000) and
politely said that the arrangement wasn’t working out. The
CEO answered by saying the bill was too high, that he’d pay
half of it and that they would talk about the rest. After that, he stopped answering her calls. The underlying dynamic was that this guy didn’t like
being questioned by anyone, especially a woman.",
3816,Never split the difference,"So she
and I developed a strategy that showed him she understood
where she went wrong and acknowledged his power, while
at the same time directing his energy toward solving her
problem. The script we came up with hit all the best practices of
negotiation we’ve talked about so far. Here it is by steps:
1. A “No”-oriented email question to reinitiate
contact: “Have you given up on settling this
amicably?”
2. A statement that leaves only the answer of
“That’s right” to form a dynamic of agreement:
“It seems that you feel my bill is not justified.”
3. Calibrated questions about the problem to get
him to reveal his thinking: “How does this bill
violate our agreement?”
4. More 
“No”-oriented 
questions 
to 
remove
unspoken barriers: “Are you saying I misled
you?” “Are you saying I didn’t do as you
asked?” “Are you saying I reneged on our
agreement?” or “Are you saying I failed you?”
5.",
3817,Never split the difference,"Labeling and mirroring the essence of his
answers if they are not acceptable so he has to
consider them again: “It seems like you feel my
work was subpar.” Or “. . . my work was
subpar?”
6. A calibrated question in reply to any offer other
than full payment, in order to get him to offer a
solution: “How am I supposed to accept that?”
7. If none of this gets an offer of full payment, a
label that flatters his sense of control and power:
“It seems like you are the type of person who
prides himself on the way he does business—
rightfully so—and has a knack for not only
expanding the pie but making the ship run more
efficiently.”
8. A long pause and then one more “No”-oriented
question: “Do you want to be known as someone
who doesn’t fulfill agreements?”
From my long experience in negotiation, scripts like this
have a 90 percent success rate. That is, if the negotiator
stays calm and rational. And that’s a big if. In this case, she didn’t.",
3818,Never split the difference,"The first step—the magic email—worked better than she
imagined, and the CEO called within ten minutes, surprising
her. Almost immediately her anger flared at the sound of his
patronizing voice. Her only desire became to show him how
he was wrong, to impose her will, and the conversation
became a showdown that went nowhere. You probably don’t need me to tell you that she didn’t
even get half. With that in mind, I want to end this chapter with some
advice on how to remain rational in a negotiation. Even with
all the best techniques and strategy, you need to regulate
your emotions if you want to have any hope of coming out
on top. The first and most basic rule of keeping your emotional
cool is to bite your tongue. Not literally, of course. But you
have to keep away from knee-jerk, passionate reactions. Pause. Think. Let the passion dissipate. That allows you to
collect your thoughts and be more circumspect in what you
say. It also lowers your chance of saying more than you
want to.",
3819,Never split the difference,"The Japanese have this figured out. When negotiating
with a foreigner, it’s common practice for a Japanese
businessman to use a translator even when he understands
perfectly what the other side is saying. That’s because
speaking through a translator forces him to step back. It
gives him time to frame his response. Another simple rule is, when you are verbally assaulted,
do not counterattack. Instead, disarm your counterpart by
asking a calibrated question. The next time a waiter or
salesclerk tries to engage you in a verbal skirmish, try this
out. I promise you it will change the entire tenor of the
conversation. The basic issue here is that when people feel that they
are not in control, they adopt what psychologists call a
hostage mentality. That is, in moments of conflict they react
to their lack of power by either becoming extremely
defensive or lashing out.",
3820,Never split the difference,"Neurologically, in situations like this the fight-or-flight
mechanism in the reptilian brain or the emotions in the
limbic system overwhelm the rational part of our mind, the
neocortex, leading us to overreact in an impulsive,
instinctive way. In a negotiation, like in the one between my client and
the CEO, this always produces a negative outcome. So we
have to train our neocortex to override the emotions from
the other two brains. That means biting your tongue and learning how to
mindfully change your state to something more positive. And it means lowering the hostage mentality in your
counterpart by asking a question or even offering an
apology. (“You’re right. That was a bit harsh.”)
If you were able to take an armed kidnapper who’d been
surrounded by police and hook him up to a cardiac monitor,
you’d find that every calibrated question and apology would
lower his heart rate just a little bit. And that’s how you get to
a dynamic where solutions can be found.",
3821,Never split the difference,"KEY LESSONS
Who has control in a conversation, the guy listening or the
guy talking? The listener, of course. That’s because the talker is revealing information while
the listener, if he’s trained well, is directing the conversation
toward his own goals. He’s harnessing the talker’s energy
for his own ends. When you try to work the skills from this chapter into
your daily life, remember that these are listener’s tools. They
are not about strong-arming your opponent into submission. Rather, they’re about using the counterpart’s power to get to
your objective. They’re listener’s judo. As you put listener’s judo into practice, remember the
following powerful lessons:
■
Don’t try to force your opponent to admit that
you are right. Aggressive confrontation is the
enemy of constructive negotiation. ■
Avoid questions that can be answered with
“Yes” or tiny pieces of information.",
3822,Never split the difference,"These
require little thought and inspire the human need
for reciprocity; you will be expected to give
something back. ■
Ask calibrated questions that start with the words
“How” or “What.” By implicitly asking the other
party for help, these questions will give your
counterpart an illusion of control and will inspire
them to speak at length, revealing important
information. ■
Don’t ask questions that start with “Why” unless
you want your counterpart to defend a goal that
serves you. “Why” is always an accusation, in
any language. ■
Calibrate 
your 
questions 
to 
point 
your
counterpart toward solving your problem. This
will encourage them to expend their energy on
devising a solution. ■
Bite your tongue. When you’re attacked in a
negotiation, pause and avoid angry emotional
reactions. Instead, ask your counterpart a
calibrated question. ■
There is always a team on the other side. If you
are not influencing those behind the table, you
are vulnerable.",
3823,Never split the difference,"CHAPTER 8
GUARANTEE EXECUTION
During a dangerous and chaotic prison siege in St. Martin
Parish, Louisiana, a few years ago, a group of inmates
armed with makeshift knives took the warden and some of
his staff hostage. The situation was especially nervy because
the prisoners were both tense and disorganized, a worrisome
mix that meant anything could happen. The negotiators sensed that, beneath the bluster, the
prisoners didn’t really want to hurt the staff. They knew that
they felt backed into a corner and, more than anything, they
wanted the situation to end. But there was a stumbling block: the inmates were afraid
that the prisoners who gave up after taking correctional
officers hostage, not to mention the warden, would end up
beaten, and badly. So the negotiators delivered a pair of walkie-talkies to
the inmates and designed this elaborate surrender ritual to
get the hostage-takers to end the siege.",
3824,Never split the difference,"The idea was
elegantly simple:
The inmates would send out one of their guys with a
walkie-talkie, and he’d walk past the three perimeters of
combined multiagency law enforcement that were stationed
outside the prison. Once he’d walked past the final
perimeter, he’d get into the paddy wagon and be transferred
to jail. There, he’d use the walkie-talkie to call the guys
back in the prison and say, essentially, “They didn’t kick
my ass.” And they’d know it was okay to come out just like
he did, one at a time. After some haggling, the inmates agreed with the plan
and the first inmate comes out. It starts off great. He walks
past the federal zone, then the SWAT zone, and then he
makes it to the outer perimeter. But just as he’s about to
climb into the paddy wagon, some guy sees the walkie-
talkie and says, “What the hell are you doing with that?”
and confiscates it before sending the guy off to the jail. The inmates back in the prison start to freak out because
their buddy hasn’t called.",
3825,Never split the difference,"The one with the other walkie-
talkie calls the negotiators and starts yelling, “Why didn’t he
call? They’re kicking his ass. We told you!” He starts
talking about cutting off a hostage’s finger, just to make
sure the negotiators know the inmates are for real. Now it’s the negotiators who are freaking out. They
sprint to the perimeter and start screaming at everyone. It’s
life and death at stake. Or at least an amputated finger. Finally, fifteen nail-biting minutes later, this SWAT guy
comes striding up, all proud of himself. “Some idiot gave
this dude a radio,” he says, and sort of smiles as he hands
the negotiators the walkie-talkie. The negotiators barely stop
themselves from slugging the guy before they tear off to the
jail to have the first inmate call in. Crisis averted, but barely. The point here is that your job as a negotiator isn’t just to
get to an agreement. It’s getting to one that can be
implemented and making sure that happens.",
3826,Never split the difference,"Negotiators
have to be decision architects: they have to dynamically and
adaptively design the verbal and nonverbal elements of the
negotiation to gain both consent and execution. “Yes” is nothing without “How.” While an agreement is
nice, a contract is better, and a signed check is best. You
don’t get your profits with the agreement. They come upon
implementation. Success isn’t the hostage-taker saying,
“Yes, we have a deal”; success comes afterward, when the
freed hostage says to your face, “Thank you.”
In this chapter, I’ll show how to drive toward and
achieve consent, both with those at the negotiating table and
with the invisible forces “underneath” it; distinguish true
buy-in from fake acquiescence; and guarantee execution
using the Rule of Three.",
3827,Never split the difference,"“YES” IS NOTHING WITHOUT “HOW”
About a year after the Dos Palmas crisis, I was teaching at
the FBI Academy in Quantico when the Bureau got an
urgent call from the State Department: an American had
been kidnapped in the Ecuadoran jungle by a Colombia-
based rebel group. As the FBI’s lead international hostage
negotiator, this was my baby, so I put a team together and
set up operation headquarters in Quantico. For a few years, José and his wife, Julie, had been
guiding tour groups through the jungle near the Colombian
border. Born in Ecuador, José had become an American
citizen and was working as a paramedic in New York City
when he and Julie decided to set up an ecotourism business
in his native country. José loved the Ecuadoran jungle, and
he’d long dreamed of teaching visitors about the monkeys
that swung through the trees and the flowers that perfumed
the trails.",
3828,Never split the difference,"The business grew as ecotourists fell for the pair’s
obvious passion, and on August 20, 2003, José and Julie
took eleven people on a white-water rafting trip down the
Mira River. After a great day on the water, everyone was
smiling and soaked as they piled into Jeeps and pickups for
the ride to an inn in a nearby village. José told tall tales as
he drove the lead truck, Julie to his right with their eleven-
month-old baby in her lap. They were five minutes from the inn when three men
jumped into the road and aimed guns at the truck. A fourth
man emerged and held a revolver to Julie’s head as the
thugs pulled José from the car and forced him into the truck
bed. The kidnappers then ordered the caravan through
several small towns to a fork in the road, where they got out
and walked José past Julie’s seat in the cab. “Just remember,” Julie said, “no matter what happens, I
love you.”
“Don’t worry. I’ll be fine,” José answered. And then he and his captors disappeared into the jungle.",
3829,Never split the difference,"The captors wanted $5 million. We wanted to buy time. Ever since the Dos Palmas debacle and the Pittsburgh
epiphany, I had been raring to employ the lessons we’d
learned about calibrated questions. So when José was
kidnapped, I sent my guys down to Ecuador and told them
that we had a new strategy. The kidnapping would provide
an opportunity to prove this approach. “All we’re going to say is, ‘Hey, how do we know José
is okay? How are we supposed to pay until we know José is
okay?’ Again and again,” I told them. Although they were queasy about untested techniques,
my guys were game. The local cops were livid, though,
because they always did proof of life the old-fashioned way
(which the FBI had taught them in the first place). Luckily
Julie was with us 100 percent because she saw how the
calibrated questions would stall for time, and she was
convinced that with enough time her husband would find a
way to get home.",
3830,Never split the difference,"The day after the kidnapping, the rebels marched José
into the mountains along the Colombian border and settled
in a cabin high in the jungle. There José built a rapport with
the kidnappers to make himself harder for them to kill. He
impressed them with his knowledge of the jungle and, with
a black belt in karate, he filled the time by teaching them
martial arts. My negotiators coached Julie every day as we waited for
contact from the rebels. We learned later that the designated
negotiator from José’s captors had to walk to town to
negotiate by phone. My guys told Julie to answer every one of the
kidnappers’ demands with a question. My strategy was to
keep the kidnappers engaged but off balance. “How do I know José is alive?” she asked the first time
they talked. To their demand for $5 million, she said, “We don’t
have that kind of money. How can we raise that much?”
“How can we pay you anything until we know José is
okay?” Julie asked the next time they talked.",
3831,Never split the difference,"Questions, always questions. The kidnapper who was negotiating with Julie seemed
extremely perplexed by her persistent questions, and he kept
asking for time to think. That slowed everything down, but
he never got angry with Julie. Answering questions gave
him the illusion that he had control of the negotiation. By constantly asking questions and making minuscule
offers, Julie drove the ransom down to $16,500. When they
came to that number, the kidnappers demanded she get it to
them immediately. “How can I do that when I have to sell my cars and
trucks?” she asked. Always buying more time. We were starting to grin because success was within
reach; we were really close to a ransom that the family could
afford. And then I got a phone call in the middle of the night
from one of my deployed guys in Ecuador, Kevin Rust. Kevin is a terrific negotiator and the same guy who’d called
to tell me a year earlier that Martin Burnham had been
killed.",
3832,Never split the difference,"My stomach tied into a knot when I heard his voice. “We just got a call from José,” Kevin said. “He’s still in
guerrilla territory but he escaped and he’s on a bus and he’s
making his way out.”
It took me half a minute to respond, and when I did all I
could say was “Holy shit! That’s fantastic news!”
What had happened, we learned later, was that with all
the delays and questions, some of the guerrillas peeled off
and didn’t return. Pretty soon there was only one teenager
guarding José at night. He saw an opening late one evening
when it began to chuck down rain. Pounding on the metal
roof, the rain drowned out all other sound as the lone guard
slept. Knowing the wet leaves outside would absorb the
sound of his footsteps, José climbed through the window,
ran down jungle paths to a dirt road, and worked his way to
a small town. Two days later he was back with Julie and their baby,
just a few days before his daughter’s first birthday.",
3833,Never split the difference,"Julie was right: with enough time he had found a way
home. Calibrated “How” questions are a surefire way to keep
negotiations going. They put the pressure on your
counterpart to come up with answers, and to contemplate
your problems when making their demands. With enough of the right “How” questions you can read
and shape the negotiating environment in such a way that
you’ll eventually get to the answer you want to hear. You
just have to have an idea of where you want the
conversation to go when you’re devising your questions. The trick to “How” questions is that, correctly used, they
are gentle and graceful ways to say “No” and guide your
counterpart to develop a better solution—your solution. A
gentle How/No invites collaboration and leaves your
counterpart with a feeling of having been treated with
respect. Look back at what Julie did when the Colombian rebel
kidnappers made their first demands. “How can we raise that much?” she asked.",
3834,Never split the difference,"Notice that she did not use the word “No.” But she still
managed to elegantly deny the kidnappers’ $5 million
demand. As Julie did, the first and most common “No” question
you’ll use is some version of “How am I supposed to do
that?” (for example, “How can we raise that much?”). Your
tone of voice is critical as this phrase can be delivered as
either an accusation or a request for assistance. So pay
attention to your voice. This question tends to have the positive effect of making
the other side take a good look at your situation. This
positive dynamic is what I refer to as “forced empathy,” and
it’s especially effective if leading up to it you’ve already
been empathic with your counterpart. This engages the
dynamic of reciprocity to lead them to do something for
you. Starting with José’s kidnapping, “How am I supposed
to do that?” became our primary response to a kidnapper
demanding a ransom. And we never had it backfire.",
3835,Never split the difference,"Once I was working with an accounting consultant
named Kelly who was owed a pile of money by a corporate
client. She kept consulting because she believed she was
developing a useful contact, and because the promise of a
future payday seemed to justify continuing in good faith. But at a certain point Kelly was so far behind on her own
bills that she was in a bind. She couldn’t continue to work
with only a vague idea of when she’d get paid, but she
worried that if she pushed too hard she wouldn’t get paid at
all. I told her to wait until the client asked for more work,
because if she made a firm payment demand right away she
would be vulnerable if they refused. Luckily for Kelly, the client soon called to ask her for
more work.",
3836,Never split the difference,"Once he finished his request, she calmly asked a
“How” question:
“I’d love to help,” she said, “but how am I supposed to
do that?”
By indicating her willingness to work but asking for help
finding a way to do so, she left her deadbeat customer with
no choice but to put her needs ahead of everything else. And she got paid. Besides saying “No,” the other key benefit of asking
“How?” is, quite literally, that it forces your counterpart to
consider and explain how a deal will be implemented. A
deal is nothing without good implementation. Poor
implementation is the cancer that eats your profits. By making your counterparts articulate implementation
in their own words, your carefully calibrated “How”
questions will convince them that the final solution is their
idea. And that’s crucial. People always make more effort to
implement a solution when they think it’s theirs. That is
simply human nature.",
3837,Never split the difference,"That’s why negotiation is often called
“the art of letting someone else have your way.”
There are two key questions you can ask to push your
counterparts to think they are defining success their way:
“How will we know we’re on track?” and “How will we
address things if we find we’re off track?” When they
answer, you summarize their answers until you get a “That’s
right.” Then you’ll know they’ve bought in. On the flip side, be wary of two telling signs that your
counterpart doesn’t believe the idea is theirs. As I’ve noted,
when they say, “You’re right,” it’s often a good indicator
they are not vested in what is being discussed. And when
you push for implementation and they say, “I’ll try,” you
should get a sinking feeling in your stomach. Because this
really means, “I plan to fail.”
When you hear either of these, dive back in with
calibrated “How” questions until they define the terms of
successful implementation in their own voice.",
3838,Never split the difference,"Follow up by
summarizing what they have said to get a “That’s right.”
Let the other side feel victory. Let them think it was their
idea. Subsume your ego. Remember: “Yes” is nothing
without “How.” So keep asking “How?” And succeed. INFLUENCING THOSE BEHIND THE TABLE
A few weeks after José got back to the United States, I
drove to his family’s place in upstate New York. I was thrilled when José escaped, but the case left me
with one nagging worry: Had my new strategy failed? You
see, José had gotten home safely, but not because we’d
negotiated his release. I worried that our winning had less to
do with our brilliant strategy than with dumb luck. After being greeted warmly by Julie and her parents,
José and I grabbed some coffee and sat down. I’d gone
there to do what CNU referred to as a hostage survival
debriefing. I was after insights into how to better advise
people facing potential kidnappings how best to survive, not
just physically, but psychologically.",
3839,Never split the difference,"I was also burning to
find out what had occurred behind the scenes because it
seemed as if my new strategy hadn’t worked. Finally the conversation came around to our use of
calibrated questions. “You know what?” he said. “The craziest thing was that
their negotiator was supposed to stay in town and negotiate
the deal but because Julie kept asking him questions he
didn’t really know for sure how to answer, he kept coming
out to the jungle. They all would get together and have a
huge discussion about how to respond. They even thought
about taking me into town and putting me on the phone
because Julie was so persistent with asking how did she
know if I was okay.”
Right then I knew we had the right tool.",
3840,Never split the difference,"It was exactly
the opposite of the Burnham case, where our negotiator cut
the deal with one of the guys and then the rest of them took
the $300,000 and said, “No, we’re not doing that.” Causing
the other side to work that hard and forcing that much
internal coordination in service of our own goals was
unprecedented. Our negotiating strategy in Ecuador worked not just
because the questions contributed to the environment that let
José escape, but because they made sure the kidnappers—
our counterparts—were all on the same page. Yes, few hostage-takers—and few business deal makers
—fly solo. But for the most part, there are almost always
other players, people who can act as deal makers or deal
killers. If you truly want to get to “Yes” and get your deal
implemented, you have to discover how to affect these
individuals. When implementation happens by committee, the
support of that committee is key.",
3841,Never split the difference,"You always have to
identify and unearth their motivations, even if you haven’t
yet identified each individual on that committee. That can be
easy as asking a few calibrated questions, like “How does
this affect the rest of your team?” or “How on board are the
people not on this call?” or simply “What do your
colleagues see as their main challenges in this area?”
The larger concept I’m explaining here is that in any
negotiation you have to analyze the entire negotiation space. When other people will be affected by what is negotiated
and can assert their rights or power later on, it’s just stupid
to consider only the interests of those at the negotiation
table. You have to beware of “behind the table” or “Level
II” players—that is, parties that are not directly involved but
who can help implement agreements they like and block
ones they don’t. You can’t disregard them even when
you’re talking to a CEO. There could always be someone
whispering into his ear.",
3842,Never split the difference,"At the end of the day, the deal
killers often are more important than the deal makers. Think back to the prison siege: it was almost ruined
because one bit player on our side was not totally on board. That’s what our use of calibrated questions in Ecuador
avoided, and that’s why José’s case was a home run. It only takes one bit player to screw up a deal. A few years into private practice I’d lost sight of the
importance of assessing and influencing the hidden
negotiation that happens “behind the table,” and I paid a
substantial price. We were closing a deal with a big company in Florida
that wanted negotiation training for one of its divisions. We’d been on the phone a bunch of times with the CEO and
the head of HR, and they were both 100 percent gung ho on
our offering. We were elated—we had what we thought was
total buy-in from the top decision makers for an incredibly
lucrative deal. And then, as we were figuring out the small print, the
deal fell off the table.",
3843,Never split the difference,"It turns out that the head of the division that needed the
training killed the deal. Maybe this guy felt threatened,
slighted, or otherwise somehow personally injured by the
notion that he and his people “needed” any training at all. (A surprisingly high percentage of negotiations hinge on
something outside dollars and cents, often having more to
do with self-esteem, status, and other nonfinancial needs.)
We’ll never know now. The point is, we didn’t care until too late because we
convinced ourselves that we were on the phone with the
only decision makers that mattered. We could have avoided all that had we asked a few
calibrated questions, like: How does this affect everybody
else? How on board is the rest of your team? How do we
make sure that we deliver the right material to the right
people? How do we ensure the managers of those we’re
training are fully on board?",
3844,Never split the difference,"If we had asked questions like that, the CEO and HR
head would have checked with this guy, maybe even
brought him into the conversation. And saved us all a lot of
pain. SPOTTING LIARS, DEALING WITH JERKS, AND
CHARMING EVERYONE ELSE
As a negotiator, you’re going to run into guys who lie to
your face and try to scare you into agreement. Aggressive
jerks and serial fabricators come with the territory, and
dealing with them is something you have to do. But learning how to handle aggression and identify
falsehood is just part of a larger issue: that is, learning how
to spot and interpret the subtleties of communication—both
verbal and nonverbal—that reveal the mental states of your
counterparts. Truly effective negotiators are conscious of the verbal,
paraverbal (how it’s said), and nonverbal communications
that pervade negotiations and group dynamics. And they
know how to employ those subtleties to their benefit.",
3845,Never split the difference,"Even
changing a single word when you present options—like
using “not lose” instead of “keep”—can unconsciously
influence the conscious choices your counterpart makes. Here I want to talk about the tools you need to ID liars,
disarm jerks, and charm everybody else. Of course, the
open-ended “How” question is one of them—maybe the
most important one—but there are many more. Alastair Onglingswan was living in the Philippines when,
one evening in 2004, he hailed a taxi and settled in for a
long ride home from Manila’s Greenhills shopping center. He dozed off. And he woke up in chains. Unfortunately for Alastair, the cabbie had a second
business as a kidnapper. He kept a bottle of ether in his front
seat, and when a target fell asleep he would drug him,
imprison him, and ask for ransom. Within hours, the kidnapper used Alastair’s phone to
contact his girlfriend in New York. He demanded a daily
payment to “take care” of Alastair while he researched the
family’s wealth.",
3846,Never split the difference,"“It’s okay if you don’t pay,” he said. “I can always sell
his organs in Saudi Arabia.”
Within twenty-four hours, I’d been charged with heading
the negotiation from Quantico. Alastair’s girlfriend was too
nervous to handle the family side of the negotiation, and his
mother, who lived in the Philippines, just wanted to accept
any demand the kidnapper made. But Alastair’s brother Aaron, in Manila, was different: he
just got the idea of negotiation and he accepted that Alastair
might die, which would make him a better and more
effective negotiator. Aaron and I set up an always-on phone
line and I became Aaron’s guru on the other side of the
world. Through the kidnapper’s comments and demands, I saw
that he was experienced and patient. As a token of his
intentions, he offered to cut off one of Alastair’s ears and
send it to the family along with a video of him severing the
ear.",
3847,Never split the difference,"The demand for the daily payment was clearly a trick to
quickly drain the family of as much money as possible
while at the same time gauging their wealth. We had to
figure out who this guy was—Was he a lone operator or part
of a group? Did he plan on killing Alastair or not?—and we
had to do that before the family went broke. To get there,
we were going to have to engage the kidnapper in a
protracted negotiation. We were going to have to slow
everything down. From Quantico, I loaded Aaron up with calibrated
questions. I instructed him to keep peppering the violent
jerk with “How?” How am I supposed to . . . ? How do we
know . . . ? How can we . . . ? There is great power in
treating jerks with deference. It gives you the ability to be
extremely assertive—to say “No”—in a hidden fashion. “How do we know if we pay you that you won’t hurt
Alastair?” Aaron asked.",
3848,Never split the difference,"In the Chinese martial art of tai chi, the goal is to use
your opponent’s aggressiveness against him—to turn his
offense into your way to defeat him. That’s the approach we
took with Alastair’s kidnapper: we wanted to absorb his
threats and wear him down. We made sure that even
scheduling a call with us was complex. We delayed making
email responses. Through all these tactics, we gained the upper hand
while giving the kidnapper the illusion of control. He
thought he was solving Aaron’s problems while we were
just reading him and wasting his time. You see, it’s best not
to go chin to chin with aggressiveness like that of Alastair’s
kidnapper; rather, default to using “what” and “how”
questions to avoid making bids or adjusting your own
negotiating position. Dodge and weave. Finally, following days of back-and-forth bargaining on
the daily rate, Aaron got the kidnapper down to a token
amount and agreed to deposit a portion of the funds in his
bank account.",
3849,Never split the difference,"After that partial payment was made, Aaron
came up with the perfect way to nonconfrontationally
confront the cabbie with a calibrated “When/What”
question. “When we run out of money, what will happen?” Aaron
asked. The kidnapper paused. “It will be all right,” he finally responded. Yes! Without realizing what he had just agreed to, our killer
had just promised us he wouldn’t hurt Alastair. A repetitive
series of “What” and “How” questions can help you
overcome the aggressive tactics of a manipulative
adversary. As you can see in that last exchange, the kidnapper’s
protracted chats with Aaron had turned Aaron almost into a
friend. Over time the kidnapper had become unguarded
about spending time on the phone with his “friend.” Finally,
the Philippine National Police investigators tracked the
phone to a house and raided it. The kidnapper and Alastair
were not there, but the kidnapper’s wife was. She told the
police about another house they owned.",
3850,Never split the difference,"The police quickly
raided the other house, freed Alastair, and arrested the
kidnapper. There are plenty of other tactics, tools, and methods for
using subtle verbal and nonverbal forms of communication
to understand and modify the mental states of your
counterpart. As I run through some of them here, I want you
to take a moment to internalize each one. These are the kind
of tools that can help observant negotiators hit home runs. THE 7-38-55 PERCENT RULE
In two famous studies on what makes us like or dislike
somebody,1 UCLA psychology professor Albert Mehrabian
created the 7-38-55 rule. That is, only 7 percent of a
message is based on the words while 38 percent comes from
the tone of voice and 55 percent from the speaker’s body
language and face. While these figures mainly relate to situations where we
are forming an attitude about somebody, the rule
nonetheless offers a useful ratio for negotiators.",
3851,Never split the difference,"You see,
body language and tone of voice—not words—are our most
powerful assessment tools. That’s why I’ll often fly great
distances to meet someone face-to-face, even when I can
say much of what needs to be said over the phone. So how do you use this rule? First, pay very close
attention to tone and body language to make sure they
match up with the literal meaning of the words. If they don’t
align, it’s quite possible that the speaker is lying or at least
unconvinced. When someone’s tone of voice or body language does
not align with the meaning of the words they say, use labels
to discover the source of the incongruence. Here’s an example:
You: “So we’re agreed?”
Them: “Yes . . .”
You: “I heard you say, ‘Yes,’ but it seemed like there
was hesitation in your voice.”
Them: “Oh, it’s nothing really.”
You: “No, this is important, let’s make sure we get this
right.”
Them: “Thanks, I appreciate it.”
This is the way to make sure your agreement gets
implemented with no surprises.",
3852,Never split the difference,"And your counterpart will
be grateful. Your act of recognizing the incongruence and
gently dealing with it through a label will make them feel
respected. Consequently, your relationship of trust will be
improved. THE RULE OF THREE
I’m positive that sometime in your life you’ve been
involved in a negotiation where you got a “Yes” that later
turned out to be a “No.” Maybe the other party was lying to
you, or maybe they were just engaged in wishful thinking. Either way, this is not an uncommon experience. This happens because there are actually three kinds of
“Yes”: Commitment, Confirmation, and Counterfeit. As we discussed in Chapter 5, so many pushy salesman
try to trap their clients into the Commitment “Yes” that
many people get very good at the Counterfeit “Yes. “
One great tool for avoiding this trap is the Rule of Three. The Rule of Three is simply getting the other guy to
agree to the same thing three times in the same
conversation.",
3853,Never split the difference,"It’s tripling the strength of whatever dynamic
you’re trying to drill into at the moment. In doing so, it
uncovers problems before they happen. It’s really hard to
repeatedly lie or fake conviction. When I first learned this skill, my biggest fear was how
to avoid sounding like a broken record or coming off as
really pushy. The answer, I learned, is to vary your tactics. The first time they agree to something or give you a
commitment, that’s No. 1. For No. 2 you might label or
summarize what they said so they answer, “That’s right.”
And No. 3 could be a calibrated “How” or “What” question
about implementation that asks them to explain what will
constitute success, something like “What do we do if we get
off track?”
Or the three times might just be the same calibrated
question phrased three different ways, like “What’s the
biggest challenge you faced? What are we up against here?",
3854,Never split the difference,"What do you see as being the most difficult thing to get
around?”
Either way, going at the same issue three times uncovers
falsehoods as well as the incongruences between words and
body language we mentioned in the last section. So next
time you’re not sure your counterpart is truthful and
committed, try it. THE PINOCCHIO EFFECT
With Carlo Collodi’s famous character Pinocchio, it was
easy to tell when he was lying: you just had to watch the
nose. It turns out that Collodi wasn’t far off reality. Most
people offer obvious telltale signs when they’re lying. Not a
growing nose, but close enough. In a study of the components of lying,2 Harvard
Business School professor Deepak Malhotra and his
coauthors found that, on average, liars use more words than
truth tellers and use far more third-person pronouns. They
start talking about him, her, it, one, they, and their rather
than I, in order to put some distance between themselves
and the lie.",
3855,Never split the difference,"And they discovered that liars tend to speak in more
complex sentences in an attempt to win over their suspicious
counterparts. It’s what W. C. Fields meant when he talked
about baffling someone with bullshit. The researchers
dubbed this the Pinocchio Effect because, just like
Pinocchio’s nose, the number of words grew along with the
lie. People who are lying are, understandably, more worried
about being believed, so they work harder—too hard, as it
were—at being believable. PAY ATTENTION TO THEIR USAGE OF PRONOUNS
The use of pronouns by a counterpart can also help give
you a feel for their actual importance in the decision and
implementation chains on the other side of the table. The
more in love they are with “I,” “me,” and “my” the less
important they are. Conversely, the harder it is to get a first person pronoun
out of a negotiator’s mouth, the more important they are.",
3856,Never split the difference,"Just like in the Malhotra study where the liar is distancing
himself from the lie, in a negotiation, smart decision makers
don’t want to be cornered at the table into making a
decision. They will defer to the people away from the table
to keep from getting pinned down. Our cabdriver kidnapper in the Philippines of Alastair
Onglingswan used “we,” “they,” and “them” so rigorously
early on in the kidnapping I was convinced we were
engaged with their leader. I just never knew how literally
true it was until the rescue. In the Chase Manhattan Bank
robbery from Chapter 2, the bank robber Chris Watts
consistently talked out how dangerous the “others” were
and how little influence he had on them, all a lie. THE CHRIS DISCOUNT
People always talk about remembering and using (but not
overusing) your counterpart’s name in a negotiation. And
that’s important. The reality though is people are often tired
of being hammered with their own name.",
3857,Never split the difference,"The slick
salesman trying to drive them to “Yes” will hit them with it
over and over. Instead, take a different tack and use your own name. That’s how I get the Chris discount. Just as using Alastair’s name with the kidnapper and
getting him to use it back humanized the hostage and made
it less likely he would be harmed, using your own name
creates the dynamic of “forced empathy.” It makes the other
side see you as a person. A few years ago I was in a bar in Kansas with a bunch of
fellow FBI negotiators. The bar was packed, but I saw one
empty chair. I moved toward it but just as I got ready to sit
the guy next to it said, “Don’t even think about it.”
“Why?” I asked, and he said, “Because I’ll kick your
ass.”
He was big, burly, and already drunk, but look, I’m a
lifelong hostage negotiator—I gravitate toward tense
situations that need mediation like a moth to the flame.",
3858,Never split the difference,"I held out my hand to shake his and said, “My name is
Chris.”
The dude froze, and in the pause my fellow FBI guys
moved in, patted him on the shoulders, and offered to buy
him a drink. Turned out he was a Vietnam veteran at a
particularly low point. He was in a packed bar where the
entire world seemed to be celebrating. The only thing he
could think of was to fight. But as soon as I became “Chris,”
everything changed. Now take that mindset to a financial negotiation. I was in
an outlet mall a few months after the Kansas experience and
I picked out some shirts in one of the stores. At the front
counter the young lady asked me if I wanted to join their
frequent buyer program. I asked her if I got a discount for joining and she said,
“No.”
So I decided to try another angle. I said in a friendly
manner, “My name is Chris. What’s the Chris discount?”
She looked from the register, met my eyes, and gave a
little laugh.",
3859,Never split the difference,"“I’ll have to ask my manager, Kathy,” she said and
turned to the woman who’d been standing next to her. Kathy, who’d heard the whole exchange, said, “The best
I can do is ten percent.”
Humanize yourself. Use your name to introduce
yourself. Say it in a fun, friendly way. Let them enjoy the
interaction, too. And get your own special price. HOW TO GET YOUR COUNTERPARTS TO BID
AGAINST THEMSELVES
Like you saw Aaron and Julie do with their kidnappers, the
best way to get your counterparts to lower their demands is
to say “No” using “How” questions. These indirect ways of
saying “No” won’t shut down your counterpart the way a
blunt, pride-piercing “No” would. In fact, these responses
will sound so much like counterbids that your counterparts
will often keep bidding against themselves. We’ve found that you can usually express “No” four
times before actually saying the word.",
3860,Never split the difference,"The first step in the “No” series is the old standby:
“How am I supposed to do that?”
You have to deliver it in a deferential way, so it becomes
a request for help. Properly delivered, it invites the other
side to participate in your dilemma and solve it with a better
offer. After that, some version of “Your offer is very generous,
I’m sorry, that just doesn’t work for me” is an elegant
second way to say “No.”
This well-tested response avoids making a counteroffer,
and the use of “generous” nurtures your counterpart to live
up to the word. The “I’m sorry” also softens the “No” and
builds empathy. (You can ignore the so-called negotiating
experts who say apologies are always signs of weakness.)
Then you can use something like “I’m sorry but I’m
afraid I just can’t do that.” It’s a little more direct, and the
“can’t do that” does great double duty. By expressing an
inability to perform, it can trigger the other side’s empathy
toward you.",
3861,Never split the difference,"“I’m sorry, no” is a slightly more succinct version for the
fourth “No.” If delivered gently, it barely sounds negative at
all. If you have to go further, of course, “No” is the last and
most direct way. Verbally, it should be delivered with a
downward inflection and a tone of regard; it’s not meant to
be “NO!”
One of my students, a guy named Jesus Bueno, wrote me
not long ago to tell me an amazing story about how he’d
used the multi-step “No” to help his brother Joaquin out of a
sticky business situation. His brother and two friends had bought a cannabis grow
shop franchise in northern Spain, where the cultivation of
marijuana for personal use is legal. Joaquin and his partner,
Bruno, each invested 20,000 euros in the business for a 46
percent stake (a minority partner invested another €3,500
for 8 percent). From the beginning, Joaquin and Bruno had a rocky
relationship. Joaquin is an excellent salesman, while Bruno
was more of a bookkeeper.",
3862,Never split the difference,"The minority partner was also an
excellent salesman, and he and Joaquin believed that
growing sales was the correct strategy. That meant offering
discounts for large orders and repeat customers, which
Bruno disagreed with. Their planned spending on launching
a website and expanding inventory also rubbed Bruno the
wrong way. Then Bruno’s wife became a problem as she started
nagging Joaquin about how he should not spend so much
on expansion and instead take more profits. One day,
Joaquin was reviewing inventory purchases and noticed that
some items they had ordered had not been placed on the
store’s shelves. He began searching for them online and to
his surprise he found an eBay store set up with the wife’s
first name that was selling exactly those missing products. This started a huge argument between Bruno and
Joaquin, and soured their relationship.",
3863,Never split the difference,"In the heat of the
moment, Bruno told Joaquin that he was open to selling his
shares because he felt the business risks they were taking
were too large. So Joaquin consulted with his brother: my
student Jesus. Because they believed that pressure from Bruno’s wife
was why he wanted to sell, Jesus helped Joaquin craft an
empathy message around that: “It seems like you are under
a lot of pressure from your wife.” Joaquin was also in the
middle of a divorce, so they decided to use that to relate to
the wife issues, and they prepared an accusation audit—“I
know you think I don’t care about costs and taking profits
from the company”—in order to diffuse the negative energy
and get Bruno talking. It worked like a charm. Bruno immediately agreed with
the accusation audit and began explaining why he thought
Joaquin was careless with spending. Bruno also noted that
he didn’t have someone to bail him out like Joaquin did
(Joaquin got a start-up loan from his mother).",
3864,Never split the difference,"Joaquin used
mirrors to keep Bruno talking, and he did. Finally, Joaquin said, “I know how the pressure from
your wife can feel, I’m going through a divorce myself and
it really takes a lot out of you.” Bruno then went on a ten-
minute rant about his wife and let slip a huge piece of
information: the wife was very upset because the bank that
lent them the €20,000 had reviewed their loan and had
given them two options: repay the loan in full, or pay a
much higher interest rate. Bingo! Joaquin and Jesus huddled after learning that, and
decided that Joaquin could reasonably pay just above the
loan price because Bruno had already taken €14,000 in
salary from the business. The letter from the bank put Bruno
in a bad spot, and Joaquin figured he could bid low because
there wasn’t really a market for Bruno to sell his shares. They decided that €23,000 would be the magic number,
with €11,000 up front with the remaining €12,000 over a
year period. Then things went sideways.",
3865,Never split the difference,"Instead of waiting for Bruno to name a price, Joaquin
jumped the gun and made his full offer, telling Bruno that
he thought it was “very fair.” If there’s one way to put off
your counterpart, it’s by implying that disagreeing with you
is unfair. What happened next proved that. Bruno angrily hung up the phone and two days later
Joaquin received an email from a guy saying he’d been
hired to represent Bruno. They wanted €30,812: €20,000 for
the loan, €4,000 for salary, €6,230 for equity, and €582 for
interest. Nonround figures that seemed unchangeable in their
specificity. This guy was a pro. Jesus told Joaquin that he’d truly screwed up. But they
both knew that Bruno was pretty desperate to sell. So they
decided to use the multi-step “No” strategy to get Bruno to
bid against himself. The worst-case scenario, they decided,
was that Bruno would just change his mind about selling his
shares and the status quo would continue. It was a risk
they’d have to take.",
3866,Never split the difference,"They crafted their first “No” message:
The price you offered is very fair, and I certainly
wish that I could afford it. Bruno has worked very
hard for this business, and he deserves to be
compensated appropriately. I am very sorry, but
wish you the best of luck. Notice how they made no counteroffer and said “No”
without using the word? Joaquin was shocked when the following day he
received an email from the advisor lowering the price to
€28,346. Joaquin and Jesus then crafted their second gentle “No”:
Thank you for your offer. You were generous to
reduce the price, which I greatly appreciate. I really
wish that I could pay you this amount, but I am
sincere in that I cannot afford this amount at this
time. As you know, I am in the middle of a divorce
and I just cannot come up with that type of money. Again, I wish you the best of luck. The next day Joaquin received a one-line email from the
advisor dropping the price to €25,000.",
3867,Never split the difference,"Joaquin wanted to
take it but Jesus told him that he had some “No” steps to go. Joaquin fought him, but in the end he relented. There’s a critical lesson there: The art of closing a deal is
staying focused to the very end. There are crucial points at
the finale when you must draw on your mental discipline. Don’t think about what time the last flight leaves, or what it
would be like to get home early and play golf. Do not let
your mind wander. Remain focused. They wrote:
Thank you again for the generous offer. You have
really come down on the price and I have tried very
hard to come up with that amount. Unfortunately, no
one is willing to lend me the money, not even my
mother. I have tried various avenues but cannot
come up with the funding. In the end, I can offer you
€23,567, although I can only pay €15,321.37 up
front. I could pay you the remainder over a one-year
period, but that is really the most I can do. I wish you
the best in your decision.",
3868,Never split the difference,"Brilliant use of specific numbers, and what an empathy-
building way to say “No” without using the word! And it worked. Within one hour, the advisor responded
to accept. Look at this closely: see how the mixture of mirroring
and open-ended questions dragged out the information
about Bruno’s financial problems, and then the “No”
method exploited his desperation? It might not have been a
great idea to use this method if there’d been another buyer,
but with no one else it was a brilliant way to get Bruno to
bid against himself. KEY LESSONS
Superstar 
negotiators—real 
rainmakers—know 
that 
a
negotiation is a playing field beneath the words, where
really getting to a good deal involves detecting and
manipulating 
subtle, 
nonobvious 
signals beneath the
surface. It is only by visualizing and modifying these
subsurface issues that you can craft a great deal and make
sure that it is implemented. As you put the following tools to use, remember this
chapter’s most important concept.",
3869,Never split the difference,"That is, “Yes” is nothing
without “How.” Asking “How,” knowing “How,” and
defining “How” are all part of the effective negotiator’s
arsenal. He would be unarmed without them. ■
Ask calibrated “How” questions, and ask them
again and again. Asking “How” keeps your
counterparts engaged but off balance. Answering
the questions will give them the illusion of
control. It will also lead them to contemplate
your problems when making their demands. ■
Use “How” questions to shape the negotiating
environment. You do this by using “How can I
do that?” as a gentle version of “No.” This will
subtly push your counterpart to search for other
solutions—your solutions. And very often it will
get them to bid against themselves. ■
Don’t just pay attention to the people you’re
negotiating with directly; always identify the
motivations of the players “behind the table.”
You can do so by asking how a deal will affect
everybody else and how on board they are.",
3870,Never split the difference,"■
Follow the 7-38-55 Percent Rule by paying close
attention to tone of voice and body language. Incongruence between the words and nonverbal
signs will show when your counterpart is lying or
uncomfortable with a deal. ■
Is the “Yes” real or counterfeit? Test it with the
Rule 
of Three: 
use 
calibrated 
questions,
summaries, and labels to get your counterpart to
reaffirm their agreement at least three times. It’s
really hard to repeatedly lie or fake conviction. ■
A person’s use of pronouns offers deep insights
into his or her relative authority. If you’re
hearing a lot of “I,” “me,” and “my,” the real
power to decide probably lies elsewhere. Picking
up a lot of “we,” “they,” and “them,” it’s more
likely you’re dealing directly with a savvy
decision maker keeping his options open. ■
Use your own name to make yourself a real
person to the other side and even get your own
personal discount. Humor and humanity are the
best ways to break the ice and remove
roadblocks.",
3871,Never split the difference,"CHAPTER 9
BARGAIN HARD
A few years ago I fell in love with a red Toyota 4Runner. Actually not just “red,” but “Salsa Red Pearl.” Kind of a
smoldering red that seemed to glow at night. How sexy is
that? I just had to have it; getting one became my obsession. I searched the dealers in metropolitan Washington, D.C.,
and I quickly realized that I wasn’t the only one obsessed
with getting that truck: there weren’t any in that color in the
entire area, none at all, save at one dealer. You know how they tell you not to shop for groceries
when you’re hungry? Well, I was hungry. Very hungry. Actually, I was in love. . . . I sat down, centered myself, and
strategized. This lot was my only shot. I had to make it
count
I drove to the dealer on a sunny Friday afternoon. I sat
down across from the salesman, a nice enough guy named
Stan, and told him how gorgeous the vehicle was.",
3872,Never split the difference,"He offered me the usual smile—he had me, he thought—
and mentioned the sticker price on “that beautiful vehicle”:
$36,000. I gave him an understanding nod and pursed my lips. The key to beginning a haggle is to rattle the other guy ever
so gently. You do it in the nicest way possible. If I could
thread that needle, I had a good chance at getting my price. “I can pay $30,000,” I said. “And I can pay it up front,
all cash. I’ll write a check today for the full amount. I’m
sorry, I’m afraid I just can’t pay any more.”
His smile flickered a little bit at the edges, as if it were
losing focus. But he tightened it down and shook his head. “I’m sure you can understand we can’t do that. The
sticker price is $36,000, after all.”
“How am I supposed to do that?” I asked deferentially. “I’m sure,” he said, then paused as if he wasn’t sure
what he’d meant to say. “I’m sure we can figure something
out with financing the $36,000.”
“It’s a beautiful truck. Really amazing.",
3873,Never split the difference,"I can’t tell you
how much I’d love to have it. It’s worth more than what I’m
offering. I’m sorry, this is really embarrassing. I just can’t
do that price.”
He stared at me in silence, a little befuddled now. Then
he stood and went into the back for what seemed like an
eternity. He was gone so long that I remember saying to
myself, “Damn! I should have come in lower! They’re
going to come all the way down.” Any response that’s not
an outright rejection of your offer means you have the edge. He returned and told me like it was Christmas that his
boss had okayed a new price: $34,000. “Wow, your offer is very generous and this is the car of
my dreams,” I said. “I really wish I could do that. I really
do. This is so embarrassing. I simply can’t.”
He dropped into silence and I didn’t take the bait. I let
the silence linger. And then with a sigh he trudged off again. He returned after another eternity. “You win,” he said.",
3874,Never split the difference,"“My manager okayed $32,500.”
He pushed a paper across the desk that even said “YOU
WIN” in big letters. The words were even surrounded with
smiley faces. “I am so grateful. You’ve been very generous, and I
can’t thank you enough. The truck is no doubt worth more
than my price,” I said. “I’m sorry, I just can’t do that.”
Up he stood again. No smile now. Still befuddled. After
a few seconds, he walked back to his manager and I leaned
back. I could taste victory. A minute later—no eternity this
time—he returned and sat. “We can do that,” he said. Two days later, I drove off in my Salsa Red Pearl Toyota
4Runner—for $30,000. God I love that truck. Still drive it today.",
3875,Never split the difference,"Most negotiations hit that inevitable point where the slightly
loose and informal interplay between two people turns to
confrontation and the proverbial “brass tacks.” You know
the moment: you’ve mirrored and labeled your way to a
degree of rapport; an accusation audit has cleared any
lingering mental or emotional obstacles, and you’ve
identified and summarized the interests and positions at
stake, eliciting a “That’s right,” and . . . Now it’s time to bargain. Here it is: the clash for cash, an uneasy dance of offers
and counters that send most people into a cold sweat. If you
count yourself among that majority, regarding the inevitable
moment as nothing more than a necessary evil, there’s a
good chance you regularly get your clock cleaned by those
who have learned to embrace it. No part of a negotiation induces more anxiety and
unfocused aggression than bargaining, which is why it’s the
part that is more often fumbled and mishandled than any
other.",
3876,Never split the difference,"It’s simply not a comfortable dynamic for most
people. Even when we have the best-laid plans, a lot of us
wimp out when we get to the moment of exchanging prices. In this chapter, I’m going to explain the tactics that make
up the bargaining process, and look at how psychological
dynamics determine which tactics should be used and how
they should be implemented. Now, bargaining is not rocket science, but it’s not simple
intuition or mathematics, either. To bargain well, you need
to shed your assumptions about the haggling process and
learn to recognize the subtle psychological strategies that
play vital roles at the bargaining table. Skilled bargainers see
more than just opening offers, counteroffers, and closing
moves. They see the psychological currents that run below
the surface. Once you’ve learned to identify these currents, you’ll be
able to “read” bargaining situations more accurately and
confidently answer the tactical questions that dog even the
best negotiators.",
3877,Never split the difference,"You’ll be ready for the “bare-knuckle bargaining.” And
they’ll never see it coming. WHAT TYPE ARE YOU? A few years ago I was on my boat with one of my
employees, a great guy named Keenon; I was supposed to
be giving him a pep talk and performance review. “When I think of what we do, I describe it as
‘uncovering the riptide,’” I said. “Uncovering the riptide,” Keenon said. “Yes, the idea is that we—you and I and everyone here
—have the skills to identify the psychological forces that are
pulling us away from shore and use them to get somewhere
more productive.”
“Somewhere more productive,” Keenon said. “Exactly,” I said. “To a place where we can . . .”
We had talked for about forty-five minutes when my son
Brandon, who runs operations for The Black Swan Group,
broke out laughing. “I can’t take it anymore! Don’t you see? Really, Dad,
don’t you see?”
I blinked. Did I see what? I asked him. “All Keenon is doing is mirroring you.",
3878,Never split the difference,"And he’s been
doing it for almost an hour.”
“Oh,” I said, my face going red as Keenon began to
laugh. He was totally right. Keenon had been playing with me
the entire time, using the psychological tool that works most
effectively with assertive guys like me: the mirror. Your personal negotiation style—and that of your
counterpart—is formed through childhood, schooling,
family, culture, and a million other factors; by recognizing it
you can identify your negotiating strengths and weaknesses
(and those of your counterpart) and adjust your mindset and
strategies accordingly. Negotiation style is a crucial variable in bargaining. If
you don’t know what instinct will tell you or the other side
to do in various circumstances, you’ll have massive trouble
gaming out effective strategies and tactics. You and your
counterpart have habits of mind and behavior, and once you
identify them you can leverage them in a strategic manner. Just like Keenon did.",
3879,Never split the difference,"There’s an entire library unto itself of research into the
archetypes and behavioral profiles of all the possible people
you’re bound to meet at the negotiating table. It’s flat-out
overwhelming, so much so that it loses its utility. Over the
last few years, in an effort primarily led by my son Brandon,
we’ve consolidated and simplified all that research, cross-
referencing it with our experiences in the field and the case
studies of our business school students, and found that
people fall into three broad categories. Some people are
Accommodators; others—like me—are basically Assertive;
and the rest are data-loving Analysts. Hollywood negotiation scenes suggest that an Assertive
style is required for effective bargaining, but each of the
styles can be effective. And to truly be effective you need
elements from all three. A study of American lawyer-negotiators1 found that 65
percent of attorneys from two major U.S.",
3880,Never split the difference,"cities used a
cooperative style while only 24 percent were truly assertive. And when these lawyers were graded for effectiveness,
more than 75 percent of the effective group came from the
cooperative type; only 12 percent were Assertive. So if
you’re not Assertive, don’t despair. Blunt assertion is
actually counterproductive most of the time. And remember, your personal negotiating style is not a
straitjacket. No one is exclusively one style. Most of us have
the capacity to throttle up our nondominant styles should the
situation call for it. But there is one basic truth about a
successful bargaining style: To be good, you have to learn
to be yourself at the bargaining table. To be great you have
to add to your strengths, not replace them. Here’s a quick guide to classifying the type of negotiator
you’re facing and the tactics that will be most fitting for you. ANALYST
Analysts are methodical and diligent. They are not in a big
rush.",
3881,Never split the difference,"Instead, they believe that as long as they are working
toward the best result in a thorough and systematic way,
time is of little consequence. Their self-image is linked to
minimizing mistakes. Their motto: As much time as it takes
to get it right. Classic analysts prefer to work on their own and rarely
deviate from their goals. They rarely show emotion, and
they often use what is very close to the FM DJ Voice I
talked about in Chapter 3, slow and measured with a
downward inflection. However, Analysts often speak in a
way that is distant and cold instead of soothing. This puts
people off without them knowing it and actually limits them
from putting their counterpart at ease and opening them up. Analysts pride themselves on not missing any details in
their extensive preparation. They will research for two
weeks to get data they might have gotten in fifteen minutes
at the negotiating table, just to keep from being surprised. Analysts hate surprises.",
3882,Never split the difference,"They are reserved problem solvers, and information
aggregators, and are hypersensitive to reciprocity. They will
give you a piece, but if they don’t get a piece in return
within a certain period of time, they lose trust and will
disengage. This can often seem to come out of nowhere, but
remember, since they like working on things alone the fact
that they are talking to you at all is, from their perspective, a
concession. They will often view concessions by their
counterpart as a new piece of information to be taken back
and evaluated. Don’t expect immediate counterproposals
from them. People like this are skeptical by nature. So asking too
many questions to start is a bad idea, because they’re not
going to want to answer until they understand all the
implications. With them, it’s vital to be prepared. Use clear
data to drive your reason; don’t ad-lib; use data comparisons
to disagree and focus on the facts; warn them of issues
early; and avoid surprises.",
3883,Never split the difference,"Silence to them is an opportunity to think. They’re not
mad at you and they’re not trying to give you a chance to
talk more. If you feel they don’t see things the way you do,
give them a chance to think first. Apologies have little value to them since they see the
negotiation and their relationship with you as a person
largely as separate things. They respond fairly well in the
moment to labels. They are not quick to answer calibrated
questions, or closed-ended questions when the answer is
“Yes.” They may need a few days to respond. If you’re an analyst you should be worried about cutting
yourself off from an essential source of data, your
counterpart. The single biggest thing you can do is to smile
when you speak. People will be more forthcoming with
information to you as a result. Smiling can also become a
habit that makes it easy for you to mask any moments
you’ve been caught off guard.",
3884,Never split the difference,"ACCOMMODATOR
The most important thing to this type of negotiator is the
time spent building the relationship. Accommodators think
as long as there is a free-flowing continuous exchange of
information time is being well spent. As long as they’re
communicating, they’re happy. Their goal is to be on great
terms with their counterpart. They love the win-win. Of the three types, they are most likely to build great
rapport without actually accomplishing anything. Accommodators want to remain friends with their
counterpart even if they can’t reach an agreement. They are
very easy to talk to, extremely friendly, and have pleasant
voices. They will yield a concession to appease or acquiesce
and hope the other side reciprocates. If your counterparts are sociable, peace-seeking,
optimistic, distractible, and poor time managers, they’re
probably Accommodators. If they’re your counterpart, be sociable and friendly.",
3885,Never split the difference,"Listen to them talk about their ideas and use calibrated
questions focused specifically on implementation to nudge
them along and find ways to translate their talk into action. Due to their tendency to be the first to activate the
reciprocity cycle, they may have agreed to give you
something they can’t actually deliver. Their approach to preparation can be lacking as they are
much more focused on the person behind the table. They
want to get to know you. They have a tremendous passion
for the spirit of negotiation and what it takes not only to
manage emotions but also to satisfy them. While it is very easy to disagree with an Accommodator,
because they want nothing more that to hear what you have
to say, uncovering their objections can be difficult. They
will have identified potential problem areas beforehand and
will leave those areas unaddressed out of fear of the conflict
they may cause.",
3886,Never split the difference,"If you have identified yourself as an Accommodator,
stick to your ability to be very likable, but do not sacrifice
your objections. Not only do the other two types need to
hear your point of view; if you are dealing with another
Accommodator they will welcome it. Also be conscious of
excess chitchat: the other two types have no use for it, and if
you’re sitting across the table from someone like yourself
you will be prone to interactions where nothing gets done. ASSERTIVE
The Assertive type believes time is money; every wasted
minute is a wasted dollar. Their self-image is linked to how
many things they can get accomplished in a period of time. For them, getting the solution perfect isn’t as important as
getting it done. Assertives are fiery people who love winning above all
else, often at the expense of others. Their colleagues and
counterparts never question where they stand because they
are always direct and candid.",
3887,Never split the difference,"They have an aggressive
communication style and they don’t worry about future
interactions. Their view of business relationships is based on
respect, nothing more and nothing less. Most of all, the Assertive wants to be heard. And not
only do they want to be heard, but they don’t actually have
the ability to listen to you until they know that you’ve heard
them. They focus on their own goals rather than people. And they tell rather than ask. When you’re dealing with Assertive types, it’s best to
focus on what they have to say, because once they are
convinced you understand them, then and only then will
they listen for your point of view. To an Assertive, every silence is an opportunity to speak
more. Mirrors are a wonderful tool with this type. So are
calibrated questions, labels, and summaries.",
3888,Never split the difference,"The most
important thing to get from an Assertive will be a “that’s
right” that may come in the form of a “that’s it exactly” or
“you hit it on the head.”
When it comes to reciprocity, this type is of the “give an
inch/take a mile” mentality. They will have figured they
deserve whatever you have given them so they will be
oblivious to expectations of owing something in return. They will actually simply be looking for the opportunity to
receive more. If they have given some kind of concession,
they are surely counting the seconds until they get
something in return. If you are an Assertive, be particularly conscious of your
tone. You will not intend to be overly harsh but you will
often come off that way. Intentionally soften your tone and
work to make it more pleasant. Use calibrated questions and
labels with your counterpart since that will also make you
more 
approachable 
and 
increase 
the 
chances 
for
collaboration.",
3889,Never split the difference,"We’ve seen how each of these groups views the importance
of time differently (time = preparation; time = relationship;
time = money). They also have completely different
interpretations of silence. I’m definitely an Assertive, and at a conference this
Accommodator type told me that he blew up a deal. I
thought, What did you do, scream at the other guy and
leave? Because that’s me blowing up a deal. But it turned out that he went silent; for an
Accommodator type, silence is anger. For Analysts, though, silence means they want to think. And Assertive types interpret your silence as either you
don’t have anything to say or you want them to talk. I’m
one, so I know: the only time I’m silent is when I’ve run out
of things to say. The funny thing is when these cross over.",
3890,Never split the difference,"When an
Analyst pauses to think, their Accommodator counterpart
gets nervous and an Assertive one starts talking, thereby
annoying the Analyst, who thinks to herself, Every time I try
to think you take that as an opportunity to talk some more. Won’t you ever shut up? Before we move on I want to talk about why people often
fail to identify their counterpart’s style. The greatest obstacle to accurately identifying someone
else’s style is what I call the “I am normal” paradox. That is,
our hypothesis that the world should look to others as it
looks to us. After all, who wouldn’t make that assumption? But while innocent and understandable, thinking you’re
normal is one of the most damaging assumptions in
negotiations. With it, we unconsciously project our own
style on the other side. But with three types of negotiators in
the world, there’s a 66 percent chance your counterpart has
a different style than yours.",
3891,Never split the difference,"A different “normal.”
A CEO once told me he expected nine of ten negotiations to
fail. This CEO was likely projecting his beliefs onto the
other side. In reality, he probably only matched with
someone like-minded one of ten times. If he understood that
his counterpart was different from him, he would most
surely have increased his success rate. From the way they prepare to the way they engage in
dialogue, the three types negotiate differently. So before you
can even think about bargaining effectively, you have to
understand your counterpart’s “normal.” You have to
identify their type by opening yourself to their difference. Because when it comes to negotiating, the Golden Rule is
wrong. The Black Swan rule is don’t treat others the way you
want to be treated; treat them the way they need to be
treated. (I’ve got a complementary PDF available that will help
you identify your type and that of those around you.",

TAKING A PUNCH
Negotiation academics like to treat bargaining as a rational
process devoid of emotion. They talk about the ZOPA—or
Zone of Possible Agreement—which is where the seller’s
and buyer’s zones cross. Say Tony wants to sell his car and
won’t take less than $5,000 and Samantha wants to buy but
won’t pay more than $6,000. The ZOPA runs from $5,000
to $6,000. Some deals have ZOPAs and some don’t. It’s all
very rational. Or so they’d have you think. You need to disabuse yourself of that notion. In a real
bargaining session, kick-ass negotiators don’t use ZOPA. Experienced negotiators often lead with a ridiculous offer,
an extreme anchor. And if you’re not prepared to handle it,
you’ll lose your moorings and immediately go to your
maximum. It’s human nature.",
3893,Never split the difference,"Like the great ear-biting
pugilist Mike Tyson once said, “Everybody has a plan until
they get punched in the mouth.”
As a well-prepared negotiator who seeks information
and gathers it relentlessly, you’re actually going to want the
other guy to name a price first, because you want to see his
hand. You’re going to welcome the extreme anchor. But
extreme anchoring is powerful and you’re human: your
emotions may well up. If they do there are ways to weather
the storm without bidding against yourself or responding
with anger. Once you learn these tactics, you’ll be prepared
to withstand the hit and counter with panache. First, deflect the punch in a way that opens up your
counterpart.",
3894,Never split the difference,"Successful negotiators often say “No” in one of
the many ways we’ve talked about (“How am I supposed to
accept that?”) or deflect the anchor with questions like
“What are we trying to accomplish here?” Responses like
these are great ways to refocus your counterpart when you
feel you’re being pulled into the compromise trap. You can also respond to a punch-in-the-face anchor by
simply pivoting to terms. What I mean by this is that when
you feel you’re being dragged into a haggle you can detour
the conversation to the nonmonetary issues that make any
final price work. You can do this directly by saying, in an encouraging
tone of voice, “Let’s put price off to the side for a moment
and talk about what would make this a good deal.” Or you
could go at it more obliquely by asking, “What else would
you be able to offer to make that a good price for me?”
And if the other side pushes you to go first, wriggle from
his grip.",
3895,Never split the difference,"Instead of naming a price, allude to an incredibly
high number that someone else might charge. Once when a
hospital chain wanted me to name a price first, I said, “Well,
if you go to Harvard Business School, they’re going to
charge you $2,500 a day per student.”
No matter what happens, the point here is to sponge up
information from your counterpart. Letting your counterpart
anchor first will give you a tremendous feel for him. All you
need to learn is how to take the first punch. One of my Georgetown MBA students, a guy named
Farouq, showed how not to fold after being punched when
he went to hit up the MBA dean for funds to hold a big
alumni event in Dubai. It was a desperate situation, because
he needed $600 and she was his last stop. At the meeting, Farouq told the dean about how excited
the students were about the trip and how beneficial it would
be for the Georgetown MBA brand in the region. Before he could even finish, the dean jumped in.",
3896,Never split the difference,"“Sounds like a great trip you guys are planning,” she
said. “But money is tight and I could authorize no more than
$300.”
Farouq hadn’t expected the dean to go so quickly. But
things don’t always go according to plan. “That is a very generous offer given your budget limits,
but I am not sure how that would help us achieve a great
reception for the alums in the region,” Farouq said,
acknowledging her limits but saying no without using the
word. Then he dropped an extreme anchor. “I have a very
high amount in my head: $1,000 is what we need.”
As expected, the extreme anchor quickly knocked the
dean off her limit. “That is severely out of my range and I am sure I can’t
authorize that. However, I will give you $500.”
Farouq was half-tempted to fold—being $100 short
wasn’t make-or-break—but he remembered the curse of
aiming low. He decided to push forward. The $500 got him closer to the goal but not quite there,
he said; $850 would work.",
3897,Never split the difference,"The dean replied by saying that she was already giving
more than what she wanted and $500 was reasonable. At
this point, if Farouq had been less prepared he would have
given up, but he was ready for the punches. “I think your offer is very reasonable and I understand
your restrictions, but I need more money to put on a great
show for the school,” he said. “How about $775?”
The dean smiled, and Farouq knew he had her. “You seem to have a specific number in your head that
you are trying to get to,” she said. “Just tell it to me.”
At that point Farouq was happy to give her his number
as he felt she was sincere. “I need $737.50 to make this work and you are my last
stop,” he said. She laughed. The dean then praised him for knowing what he wanted
and said she’d check her budget. Two days later, Farouq got
an email saying her office would put in $750.",
3898,Never split the difference,"PUNCHING BACK: USING ASSERTION WITHOUT
GETTING USED BY IT
When a negotiation is far from resolution and going
nowhere fast, you need to shake things up and get your
counterpart out of their rigid mindset. In times like this,
strong moves can be enormously effective tools. Sometimes
a situation simply calls for you to be the aggressor and
punch the other side in the face. That said, if you are basically a nice person, it will be a
real stretch to hit the other guy like Mike Tyson. You can’t
be what you’re not. As the Danish folk saying goes, “You
bake with the flour you have.” But anyone can learn a few
tools. Here are effective ways to assert smartly:
REAL ANGER, THREATS WITHOUT ANGER, AND
STRATEGIC UMBRAGE
Marwan Sinaceur of INSEAD and Stanford University’s
Larissa Tiedens found that expressions of anger increase a
negotiator’s advantage and final take.2 Anger shows
passion and conviction that can help sway the other side to
accept less.",
3899,Never split the difference,"However, by heightening your counterpart’s
sensitivity to danger and fear, your anger reduces the
resources they have for other cognitive activity, setting them
up to make bad concessions that will likely lead to
implementation problems, thus reducing your gains. Also beware: researchers have also found that
disingenuous expressions of unfelt anger—you know,
faking it—backfire, leading to intractable demands and
destroying trust. For anger to be effective, it has to be real,
the key for it is to be under control because anger also
reduces our cognitive ability. And so when someone puts out a ridiculous offer, one
that really pisses you off, take a deep breath, allow little
anger, and channel it—at the proposal, not the person—and
say, “I don’t see how that would ever work.”
Such well-timed offense-taking—known as “strategic
umbrage”—can wake your counterpart to the problem.",
3900,Never split the difference,"In
studies by Columbia University academics Daniel Ames and
Abbie Wazlawek, people on the receiving end of strategic
umbrage were more likely to rate themselves as
overassertive, even when the counterpart didn’t think so.3
The real lesson here is being aware of how this might be
used on you. Please don’t allow yourself to fall victim to
“strategic umbrage.”
Threats delivered without anger but with “poise”—that
is, confidence and self-control—are great tools. Saying,
“I’m sorry that just doesn’t work for me,” with poise, works. “WHY” QUESTIONS
Back in Chapter 7, I talked about the problems with “Why?”
Across our planet and around the universe, “Why?” makes
people defensive. As an experiment, the next time your boss wants
something done ask him or her “Why?” and watch what
happens. Then try it with a peer, a subordinate, and a friend. Observe their reactions and tell me if you don’t find some
level of defensiveness across the spectrum.",
3901,Never split the difference,"Don’t do this too
much, though, or you’ll lose your job and all your friends. The only time I say, “Why did you do that?” in a
negotiation is when I want to knock someone back. It’s an
iffy technique, though, and I wouldn’t advocate it. There is, however, another way to use “Why?”
effectively. The idea is to employ the defensiveness the
question triggers to get your counterpart to defend your
position. I know it sounds weird, but it works. The basic format
goes like this: When you want to flip a dubious counterpart
to your side, ask them, “Why would you do that?” but in a
way that the “that” favors you. Let me explain. If you are
working to lure a client away from a competitor, you might
say, “Why would you ever do business with me? Why
would you ever change from your existing supplier? They’re great!”
In these questions, the “Why?” coaxes your counterpart
into working for you.",
3902,Never split the difference,"“I” MESSAGES
Using the first-person singular pronoun is another great way
to set a boundary without escalating into confrontation. When you say, “I’m sorry, that doesn’t work for me,”
the word “I” strategically focuses your counterpart’s
attention onto you long enough for you to make a point. The traditional “I” message is to use “I” to hit the pause
button and step out of a bad dynamic. When you want to
counteract unproductive statements from your counterpart,
you can say, “I feel ___ when you ___ because ___,” and
that demands a time-out from the other person. But be careful with the big “I”: You have to be mindful
not to use a tone that is aggressive or creates an argument. It’s got to be cool and level. NO NEEDINESS: HAVING THE READY-TO-WALK
MINDSET
We’ve said previously that no deal is better than a bad deal. If you feel you can’t say “No” then you’ve taken yourself
hostage. Once you’re clear on what your bottom line is, you have
to be willing to walk away.",
3903,Never split the difference,"Never be needy for a deal. Before we move on, I want to emphasize how important it is
to maintain a collaborative relationship even when you’re
setting boundaries. Your response must always be expressed
in the form of strong, yet empathic, limit-setting boundaries
—that is, tough love—not as hatred or violence. Anger and
other strong emotions can on rare occasions be effective. But only as calculated acts, never a personal attack. In any
bare-knuckle bargaining session, the most vital principle to
keep in mind is never to look at your counterpart as an
enemy. The person across the table is never the problem. The
unsolved issue is. So focus on the issue. This is one of the
most basic tactics for avoiding emotional escalations. Our
culture demonizes people in movies and politics, which
creates the mentality that if we only got rid of the person
then everything would be okay. But this dynamic is toxic to
any negotiation. Punching back is a last resort.",
3904,Never split the difference,"Before you go there, I
always suggest an attempt at de-escalating the situation. Suggest a time-out. When your counterparts step back and
take a breath, they’ll no longer feel that they are hostage to a
bad situation. They’ll regain a sense of agency and power. And they’ll appreciate you for that. Think of punching back and boundary-setting tactics as
a flattened S-curve: you’ve accelerated up the slope of a
negotiation and hit a plateau that requires you to temporarily
stop any progress, escalate or de-escalate the issue acting as
the obstacle, and eventually bring the relationship back to a
state of rapport and get back on the slope. Taking a positive,
constructive approach to conflict involves understanding
that the bond is fundamental to any resolution. Never create
an enemy.",
3905,Never split the difference,"ACKERMAN BARGAINING
I’ve spent a lot of time talking about the psychological judo
that I’ve made my stock in trade: the calibrated questions,
the mirrors, the tools for knocking my counterpart off his
game and getting him to bid against himself. But negotiation still comes down to determining who
gets which slice of the pie, and from time to time you’re
going to be forced into some real bare-knuckle bargaining
with a hard-ass haggler. I faced bare-knuckle bargaining all the time in the
hostage world. I haggled with a lot of guys who stuck to
their game plan and were used to getting their way. “Pay or
we’ll kill,” they’d say, and they meant it. You had to have
your skills drum-tight to negotiate them down. You need
tools. Back at FBI negotiation training, I learned the haggling
system that I use to this day. And I swear by it.",
3906,Never split the difference,"I call the system the Ackerman model because it came
from this guy Mike Ackerman, an ex-CIA type who
founded a kidnap-for-ransom consulting company based out
of Miami. On many kidnappings we’d constantly be paired
with “Ackerman guys”—never Mike himself—who helped
design the haggle. After I retired from the FBI, I finally met Mike on a trip
to Miami. When I told him I also used the system for
business negotiations, he laughed and said he’d run the
system by Howard Raiffa, a legendary Harvard negotiation
guy, and Howard had said it would work in any situation. So I felt pretty justified by that. The Ackerman model is an offer-counteroffer method, at
least on the surface. But it is a very effective system for
beating the usual lackluster bargaining dynamic, which has
the predictable result of meeting in the middle. The systematized and easy-to-remember process has
only four steps:
1. Set your target price (your goal). 2. Set your first offer at 65 percent of your target
price. 3.",
3907,Never split the difference,"Calculate three raises of decreasing increments
(to 85, 95, and 100 percent). 4. Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying
“No” to get the other side to counter before you
increase your offer. 5. When calculating the final amount, use precise,
nonround numbers like, say, $37,893 rather than
$38,000. It gives the number credibility and
weight. 6. On your final number, throw in a nonmonetary
item (that they probably don’t want) to show
you’re at your limit. The genius of this system is that it incorporates the
psychological tactics we’ve discussed—reciprocity, extreme
anchors, loss aversion, and so on—without you needing to
think about them. If you’ll bear with me for a moment, I’ll go over the
steps so you see what I mean. First, the original offer of 65 percent of your target price
will set an extreme anchor, a big slap in the face that might
bring your counterpart right to their price limit.",
3908,Never split the difference,"The shock of
an extreme anchor will induce a fight-or-flight reaction in all
but the most experienced negotiators, limiting their
cognitive abilities and pushing them into rash action. Now look at the progressive offer increases to 85, 95,
and 100 percent of the target price. You’re going to drop
these in sparingly: after the counterpart has made another
offer on their end, and after you’ve thrown out a few
calibrated questions to see if you can bait them into bidding
against themselves. When you make these offers, they work on various
levels. First, they play on the norm of reciprocity; they
inspire your counterpart to make a concession, too. Just like
people are more likely to send Christmas cards to people
who first send cards to them, they are more likely to make
bargaining 
concessions 
to 
those 
who 
have 
made
compromises in their direction.",
3909,Never split the difference,"Second, the diminishing size of the increases—notice
that they decrease by half each time—convinces your
counterpart that he’s squeezing you to the point of breaking. By the time they get to the last one, they’ll feel that they’ve
really gotten every last drop. This really juices their self-esteem. Researchers have
found that people getting concessions often feel better about
the bargaining process than those who are given a single
firm, “fair” offer. In fact, they feel better even when they
end up paying more—or receiving less—than they
otherwise might. Finally, the power of nonround numbers bears
reiterating. Back in Haiti, I used to use the Ackerman system
ferociously. Over eighteen months we got two or three
kidnappings a week, so from experience, we knew the
market prices were $15,000 to $75,000 per victim. Because
I was a hard-ass, I made it my goal to get in under $5,000 in
every kidnapping that I ran. One really stands out, the first one I mentioned in this
book.",
3910,Never split the difference,"I went through the Ackerman process, knocking them
off their game with an extreme anchor, hitting them with
calibrated questions, and slowly gave progressively smaller
concessions. Finally, I dropped the weird number that
closed the deal. I’ll never forget the head of the Miami FBI
office calling my colleague the next day and saying, “Voss
got this guy out for $4,751? How does $1 make a
difference?”
They were howling with laughter, and they had a point. That $1 is ridiculous. But it works on our human nature. Notice that you can’t buy anything for $2, but you can buy
a million things for $1.99. How does a cent change
anything? It doesn’t. But it makes a difference every time. We just like $1.99 more than $2.00 even if we know it’s a
trick.",
3911,Never split the difference,"NEGOTIATING A RENT CUT AFTER RECEIVING
NOTICE OF AN INCREASE
Eight months after a Georgetown MBA student of mine
named Mishary signed a rental contract for $1,850/month,
he got some unwelcome news: his landlord informed him
that if he wanted to re-up, it would be $2,100/month for ten
months, or $2,000/month for a year. Mishary loved the place and didn’t think he’d find a
better one, but the price was already high and he couldn’t
afford more. Taking to heart our class slogan, “You fall to your
highest level of preparation,” he dove into the real estate
listings and found that prices for comparable apartments
were $1,800–$1,950/month, but none of them were in as
good a building. He then examined his own finances and
figured the rent he wanted to pay was $1,830. He requested a sit-down with his rental agent. This was going to be tough. At their meeting, Mishary laid out his situation. His
experience in the building had been really positive, he said.",
3912,Never split the difference,"And, he pointed out, he always paid on time. It would be
sad for him to leave, he said, and sad for the landlord to lose
a good tenant. The agent nodded. “Totally in agreement,” he said. “That’s why I think it
will benefit both of us to agree on renewing the lease.”
Here Mishary pulled out his research: buildings around
the neighborhood were offering “much” lower prices, he
said. “Even though your building is better in terms of
location and services, how am I supposed to pay $200
extra?”
The negotiation was on. The agent went silent for a few moments and then said,
“You make a good point, but this is still a good price. And
as you noted, we can charge a premium.”
Mishary then dropped an extreme anchor. “I fully understand, you do have a better location and
amenities. But I’m sorry, I just can’t,” he said. “Would
$1,730 a month for a year lease sound fair to you?”
The agent laughed and when he finished said there was
no way to accept that number, because it was way below
market price.",
3913,Never split the difference,"Instead of getting pulled into a haggle, Mishary smartly
pivoted to calibrated questions. “Okay, so please help me understand: how do you price
lease renewals?”
The agent didn’t say anything shocking—merely that
they used factors like area prices and supply-and-demand—
but that gave Mishary the opening to argue that his leaving
would open the landlord to the risk of having an unrented
apartment and the cost of repainting. One month unrented
would be a $2,000 loss, he said. Then he made another offer. Now, you’re probably
shaking your head that he’s making two offers without
receiving one in return. And you’re right; normally that’s
verboten. But you have to be able to improvise. If you feel
in control of a negotiation, you can do two or three moves at
a time. Don’t let the rules ruin the flow. “Let me try and move along with you: how about
$1,790 for 12 months?”
The agent paused. “Sir, I understand your concerns, and what you said
makes sense,” he said.",
3914,Never split the difference,"“Your number, though, is very low. However, give me time to think this out and we can meet at
another time. How does that sound?”
Remember, any response that is not an outright rejection
means you have the edge. Five days later the two met again. “I ran the numbers, and believe me this is a good deal,”
the agent started. “I am able to offer you $1,950 a month for
a year.”
Mishary knew he’d won. The agent just needed a little
push. So he praised the agent and said no without saying,
“No.” And notice how he brilliantly mislabels in order to get
the guy to open up? “That is generous of you, but how am I supposed to
accept it when I can move a few blocks away and stay for
$1,800? A hundred and fifty dollars a month means a lot to
me. You know I am a student. I don’t know, it seems like
you would rather run the risk of keeping the place
unrented.”
“It’s not that,” the agent answered.",
3915,Never split the difference,"“But I can’t give you
a number lower than the market.”
Mishary made a dramatic pause, as if the agent was
extracting every cent he had. “Then I tell you what, I initially went up from $1,730 to
$1,790,” he said, sighing. “I will bring it up to $1,810. And
I think this works well for both.”
The agent shook his head. “This is still lower than the market, sir. And I cannot do
that.”
Mishary then prepared to give the last of his Ackerman
offers. He went silent for a while and then asked the agent
for a pen and paper. Then he started doing fake calculations
to seem like he was really pushing himself. Finally, he looked up at the agent and said, “I did some
numbers, and the maximum I can afford is $1,829.”
The agent bobbed his head from side to side, as if
getting his mind around the offer. At last, he spoke. “Wow. $1,829,” he said. “You seem very precise. You
must be an accountant.",
3916,Never split the difference,"[Mishary was not.] Listen, I value
you wanting to renew with us and for that I think we can
make this work for a twelve-month lease.”
Ka-ching! Notice this brilliant combination of decreasing
Ackerman offers, nonround numbers, deep research, smart
labeling, and saying no without saying “No”? That’s what
gets you a rent discount when a landlord wanted to raise his
monthly take. KEY LESSONS
When push comes to shove—and it will—you’re going to
find yourself sitting across the table from a bare-knuckle
negotiator. After you’ve finished all the psychologically
nuanced stuff—the labeling and mirroring and calibrating—
you are going to have to hash out the “brass tacks.”
For most of us, that ain’t fun. Top negotiators know, however, that conflict is often the
path to great deals. And the best find ways to actually have
fun engaging in it. Conflict brings out truth, creativity, and
resolution.",
3917,Never split the difference,"So the next time you find yourself face-to-face
with a bare-knuckle bargainer, remember the lessons in this
chapter. ■
Identify your counterpart’s negotiating style. Once 
you 
know 
whether 
they 
are
Accommodator, Assertive, or Analyst, you’ll
know the correct way to approach them. ■
Prepare, prepare, prepare. When the pressure is
on, you don’t rise to the occasion; you fall to
your highest level of preparation. So design an
ambitious but legitimate goal and then game out
the labels, calibrated questions, and responses
you’ll use to get there. That way, once you’re at
the bargaining table, you won’t have to wing it. ■
Get ready to take a punch. Kick-ass negotiators
usually lead with an extreme anchor to knock
you off your game. If you’re not ready, you’ll
flee to your maximum without a fight. So prepare
your dodging tactics to avoid getting sucked into
the compromise trap. ■
Set boundaries, and learn to take a punch or
punch back, without anger.",
3918,Never split the difference,"The guy across the
table is not the problem; the situation is. ■
Prepare an Ackerman plan. Before you head into
the weeds of bargaining, you’ll need a plan of
extreme anchor, calibrated questions, and well-
defined offers. Remember: 65, 85, 95, 100
percent. Decreasing raises and ending on
nonround numbers will get your counterpart to
believe that he’s squeezing you for all you’re
worth when you’re really getting to the number
you want. CHAPTER 10
FIND THE BLACK SWAN
At 11:30 a.m. on June 17, 1981, a beautiful 70-degree
spring day with an insistent westerly breeze, thirty-seven-
year-old William Griffin left the second-floor bedroom
where he lived in his parent’s Rochester, New York, home
and trod down the shoe-buffed stairs that led to their
meticulous living room. At the bottom he stopped, paused, and then, without a
word of warning, shot off three shotgun blasts that killed his
mother and a handyman who was hanging wallpaper and
critically wounded his stepfather.",
3919,Never split the difference,"The sound reverberated in
the enclosed space. Griffin then left the house and shot a workman and two
bystanders as he jogged two blocks to the Security Trust
Company, a neighborhood bank. Seconds after he entered,
people began sprinting from the bank as Griffin took nine
bank employees hostage and ordered the customers to
leave. For the next three and a half hours, Griffin led police and
FBI agents in a violent standoff in which he shot and
wounded the first two police officers who responded to the
bank’s silent alarm, and shot six people who happened to be
walking near the bank. Griffin shot off so many rounds—
more than one hundred in all—that the police used a
garbage truck to shield one officer as he was being rescued. Waving the nine bank employees into a small office at
2:30 p.m., Griffin told the manager to call the police and
deliver a message. Outside, FBI agent Clint Van Zandt stood by while
Rochester police officer Jim O’Brien picked up the phone.",
3920,Never split the difference,"“Either you come to the front entrance doors of the bank
at three o’clock and have a shoot-out with him in the
parking lot,” the manager blurted through her tears, “or he’s
going to start killing hostages and throwing out bodies.”
Then the line went dead. Now, never in the history of the United States had a
hostage-taker killed a hostage on deadline. The deadline
was always a way to focus the mind; what the bad guys
really wanted was money, respect, and a helicopter. Everyone knew that. It was a permanent and inalterable
known known. It was the truth. But that permanent and inalterable truth was about to
change. What came next showed the power of Black Swans,
those hidden and unexpected pieces of information—those
unknown unknowns—whose unearthing has game-changing
effects on a negotiation dynamic. Negotiation breakthroughs—when the game shifts
inalterably in your favor—are created by those who can
identify and utilize Black Swans. Here’s how.",
3921,Never split the difference,"FINDING LEVERAGE IN THE PREDICTABLY
UNPREDICTABLE
At exactly 3 p.m., Griffin gestured toward one of his
hostages, a twenty-nine-year-old teller named Margaret
Moore, and told her to walk to the glass bank doors. Petrified, Moore did as she was ordered, but first cried out
that she was a single parent with a young son. Griffin didn’t seem to hear her, or to care. Once the
weeping Moore made it to the vestibule, Griffin shot off two
blasts from his twelve-gauge shotgun. Both of the heavy
rounds struck Moore in the midsection, violently blowing
her through the glass door and almost cutting her body in
half. Outside, law enforcement was stunned into silence. It
was obvious that Griffin didn’t want money or respect or an
escape route. The only way he was coming out was in a
body bag. At that moment, Griffin walked over to a full-length
bank window and pressed his body against the glass. He
was in full view of a sniper stationed in the church across
the street.",
3922,Never split the difference,"Griffin knew quite well the sniper was there;
earlier in the day he’d shot at him. Less than a second after Griffin’s silhouette appeared in
his scope, the sniper pulled the trigger. Griffin crumpled to the floor, dead. Black Swan theory tells us that things happen that were
previously thought to be impossible—or never thought of at
all. This is not the same as saying that sometimes things
happen against one-in-a-million odds, but rather that things
never imagined do come to pass. The idea of the Black Swan was popularized by risk
analyst Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his bestselling books
Fooled by Randomness (2001)1 
and The Black Swan
(2007),2 but the term goes back much further. Until the
seventeenth century, people could only imagine white
swans because all swans ever seen had possessed white
feathers.",
3923,Never split the difference,"In seventeenth-century London it was common to
refer to impossible things as “Black Swans.”
But then the Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh went
to western Australia in 1697—and saw a black swan. Suddenly the unthinkable and unthought was real. People
had always predicted that the next swan they saw would be
white, but the discovery of black swans shattered this
worldview. Black Swans are just a metaphor, of course. Think of
Pearl Harbor, the rise of the Internet, 9/11, and the recent
banking crisis. None of the events above was predicted—yet on
reflection, the markers were all there. It’s just that people
weren’t paying attention. As Taleb uses the term, the Black Swan symbolizes the
uselessness of predictions based on previous experience. Black Swans are events or pieces of knowledge that sit
outside our regular expectations and therefore cannot be
predicted. This is a crucial concept in negotiation. In every
negotiating session, there are different kinds of information.",
3924,Never split the difference,"There are those things we know, like our counterpart’s name
and their offer and our experiences from other negotiations. Those are known knowns. There are those things we are
certain that exist but we don’t know, like the possibility that
the other side might get sick and leave us with another
counterpart. Those are known unknowns and they are like
poker wild cards; you know they’re out there but you don’t
know who has them. But most important are those things we
don’t know that we don’t know, pieces of information
we’ve never imagined but that would be game changing if
uncovered. Maybe our counterpart wants the deal to fail
because he’s leaving for a competitor. These unknown unknowns are Black Swans. With their known knowns and prior expectations so firmly
guiding their approach, Van Zandt, and really, the entire
FBI, were blind to the clues and connections that showed
there was something outside of the predictable at play. They
couldn’t see the Black Swans in front of them.",
3925,Never split the difference,"I don’t mean to single out Van Zandt here. He did all of
law enforcement a service by highlighting this event and he
told me and a room full of agents the story of that horrible
June day during a training session at Quantico. It was an
introduction to the suicide-by-cop phenomenon—when an
individual deliberately creates a crisis situation to provoke a
lethal response from law enforcement—but there was an
even greater lesson at stake: the point of the story then, and
now, was how important it is to recognize the unexpected to
make sure things like Moore’s death never happen again. On that day in June 1981, O’Brien kept calling the bank,
but each time the bank employee who answered quickly
hung up. It was at that moment they should have realized
the situation was outside the known. Hostage-takers always
talked because they always had demands; they always
wanted to be heard, respected, and paid. But this guy didn’t.",
3926,Never split the difference,"Then, midway through the standoff, a police officer
entered the command post with the news that a double
homicide with a third person critically wounded had been
reported a few blocks away. “Do we need to know this?” Van Zandt said. “Is there a
connection?”
No one knew or found out in time. If they had, they
might have uncovered a second Black Swan: that Griffin
had already killed several people without making monetary
demands. And then, a few hours in, the hostage-taker had one of
the hostages read a note to the police over the phone. Curiously, there were no demands. Instead, it was a
rambling diatribe about Griffin’s life and the wrongs he’d
endured. The note was so long and unfocused it was never
read in its entirety. Because of this, one important line—
another Black Swan—wasn’t registered:
“. . . after the police take my life . .",
3927,Never split the difference,".”
Because these Black Swans weren’t uncovered, Van
Zandt and his colleagues never saw the situation for what it
was: Griffin wanted to die, and he wanted the police to do it
for him. Nothing like this—a shootout on a deadline?—had ever
happened to the FBI, so they tried to fit the information into
what had happened in the past. Into the old templates. They
wondered, What does he actually want? After scaring them
for a bit, they expected Griffin to pick up the phone and
start a dialogue. No one gets killed on deadline. Or so they thought. UNCOVERING UNKNOWN UNKNOWNS
The lesson of what happened at 3 p.m. on June 17, 1981, in
Rochester, New York, was that when bits and pieces of a
case don’t add up it’s usually because our frames of
reference are off; they will never add up unless we break
free of our expectations. Every case is new.",
3928,Never split the difference,"We must let what we know—our
known knowns—guide us but not blind us to what we do not
know; we must remain flexible and adaptable to any
situation; we must always retain a beginner’s mind; and we
must never overvalue our experience or undervalue the
informational and emotional realities served up moment by
moment in whatever situation we face. But those were not the only important lessons of that
tragic event. If an overreliance on known knowns can
shackle a negotiator to assumptions that prevent him from
seeing and hearing all that a situation presents, then perhaps
an enhanced receptivity to the unknown unknowns can free
that same negotiator to see and hear the things that can
produce dramatic breakthroughs. From the moment I heard the tale of June 17, 1981, I
realized that I had to completely change how I approached
negotiating.",
3929,Never split the difference,"I began to hypothesize that in every negotiation
each side is in possession of at least three Black Swans,
three pieces of information that, were they to be discovered
by the other side, would change everything. My experience since has proven this to be true. Now, I should note here that this is not just a small tweak
to negotiation technique. It is not coincidence that I
embraced Black Swan as the name of my company and the
symbol of our approach. Finding and acting on Black Swans mandates a shift in
your mindset. It takes negotiation from being a one-
dimensional move-countermove game of checkers to a
three-dimensional game that’s more emotional, adaptive,
intuitive . . . and truly effective. Finding Blacks Swans is no easy task, of course. We are
all to some degree blind. We do not know what is around
the corner until we turn it. By definition we do not know
what we don’t know. That’s why I say that finding and understanding Black
Swans requires a change of mindset.",
3930,Never split the difference,"You have to open up
your established pathways and embrace more intuitive and
nuanced ways of listening. This is vital to people of all walks of life, from
negotiators to inventors and marketers. What you don’t
know can kill you, or your deal. But to find it out is
incredibly difficult. The most basic challenge is that people
don’t know the questions to ask the customer, the user . . . the counterpart. Unless correctly interrogated, most people
aren’t able to articulate the information you want. The world
didn’t tell Steve Jobs that it wanted an iPad: he uncovered
our need, that Black Swan, without us knowing the
information was there. The problem is that conventional questioning and
research techniques are designed to confirm known knowns
and reduce uncertainty. They don’t dig into the unknown. Negotiations 
will 
always 
suffer 
from 
limited
predictability. Your counterpart might tell you, “It’s a lovely
plot of land,” without mentioning that it is also a Superfund
site.",
3931,Never split the difference,"They’ll say, “Are the neighbors noisy? Well, everyone
makes a bit of noise, don’t they?” when the actual fact is
that a heavy metal band practices there nightly. It is the person best able to unearth, adapt to, and exploit
the unknowns that will come out on top. To uncover these unknowns, we must interrogate our
world, must put out a call, and intensely listen to the
response. Ask lots of questions. Read nonverbal clues and
always voice your observations with your counterpart. This is nothing beyond what you’ve been learning up to
now. It is merely more intense and intuitive. You have to
feel for the truth behind the camouflage; you have to note
the small pauses that suggest discomfort and lies. Don’t look
to verify what you expect. If you do, that’s what you’ll find. Instead, you must open yourself up to the factual reality that
is in front of you. This is why my company changed its format for
preparing and engaging in a negotiation.",
3932,Never split the difference,"No matter how
much research our team has done prior to the interaction, we
always ask ourselves, “Why are they communicating what
they are communicating right now?” Remember, negotiation
is more like walking on a tightrope than competing against
an opponent. Focusing so much on the end objective will
only distract you from the next step, and that can cause you
to fall off the rope. Concentrate on the next step because the
rope will lead you to the end as long as all the steps are
completed. Most people expect that Black Swans are highly
proprietary or closely guarded information, when in fact the
information may seem completely innocuous. Either side
may be completely oblivious to its importance. Your
counterpart always has pieces of information whose value
they do not understand. THE THREE TYPES OF LEVERAGE
I’m going to come back to specific techniques for
uncovering Black Swans, but first I’d like to examine what
makes them so useful. The answer is leverage.",
3933,Never split the difference,"Black Swans are leverage
multipliers. They give you the upper hand. Now, “leverage” is the magic word, but it’s also one of
those concepts that negotiation experts casually throw about
but rarely delve into, so I’d like to do so here. In theory, leverage is the ability to inflict loss and
withhold gain. Where does your counterpart want to gain
and what do they fear losing? Discover these pieces of
information, we are told, and you’ll build leverage over the
other side’s perceptions, actions, and decisions. In practice,
where our irrational perceptions are our reality, loss and
gain are slippery notions, and it often doesn’t matter what
leverage actually exists against you; what really matters is
the leverage they think you have on them. That’s why I say
there’s always leverage: as an essentially emotional concept,
it can be manufactured whether it exists or not. If they’re talking to you, you have leverage. Who has
leverage in a kidnapping? The kidnapper or the victim’s
family?",
3934,Never split the difference,"Most people think the kidnapper has all the
leverage. Sure, the kidnapper has something you love, but
you have something they lust for. Which is more powerful? Moreover, how many buyers do the kidnappers have for the
commodity they are trying to sell? What business is
successful if there’s only one buyer? Leverage has a lot of inputs, like time and necessity and
competition. If you need to sell your house now, you have
less leverage than if you don’t have a deadline. If you want
to sell it but don’t have to, you have more. And if various
people are bidding on it at once, good on you. I should note that leverage isn’t the same thing as power. Donald Trump has tons of power, but if he’s stranded in a
desert and the owner of the only store for miles has the
water he wants, the vendor has the leverage. One way to understand leverage is as a fluid that sloshes
between the parties.",
3935,Never split the difference,"As a negotiator you should always be
aware of which side, at any given moment, feels they have
the most to lose if negotiations collapse. The party who feels
they have more to lose and are the most afraid of that loss
has less leverage, and vice versa. To get leverage, you have
to persuade your counterpart that they have something real
to lose if the deal falls through. At a taxonomic level, there are three kinds: Positive,
Negative, and Normative. POSITIVE LEVERAGE
Positive leverage is quite simply your ability as a negotiator
to provide—or withhold—things that your counterpart
wants. Whenever the other side says, “I want . . .” as in, “I
want to buy your car,” you have positive leverage. When they say that, you have power: you can make their
desire come true; you can withhold it and thereby inflict
pain; or you can use their desire to get a better deal with
another party.",
3936,Never split the difference,"Here’s an example:
Three months after you’ve put your business on the
market, a potential buyer finally tells you, “Yes, I’d like to
buy it.” You’re thrilled, but a few days later your joy turns
to disappointment when he delivers an offer so low it’s
insulting. This is the only offer you have, so what do you
do? Now, hopefully you’ve had contact with other buyers,
even casually. If you have, you can use the offer to create a
sense of competition, and thereby kick off a bidding war. At
least you’ll force them to make a choice. But even if you don’t have other offers or the interested
buyer is your first choice, you have more power than before
your counterpart revealed his desire. You control what they
want. That’s why experienced negotiators delay making
offers—they don’t want to give up leverage. Positive leverage should improve your psychology
during negotiation.",
3937,Never split the difference,"You’ve gone from a situation where you
want something from the investor to a situation where you
both want something from each other. Once you have it, you can then identify other things
your opponent wants. Maybe he wants to buy your firm
over time. Help him do that, if he’ll increase the price. Maybe his offer is all the money he has. Help him get what
he wants—your business—by saying you can only sell him
75 percent for his offer. NEGATIVE LEVERAGE
Negative leverage is what most civilians picture when they
hear the word “leverage.” It’s a negotiator’s ability to make
his counterpart suffer. And it is based on threats: you have
negative leverage if you can tell your counterpart, “If you
don’t fulfill your commitment/pay your bill/etc., I will
destroy your reputation.”
This sort of leverage gets people’s attention because of a
concept 
we’ve 
discussed: loss 
aversion.",
3938,Never split the difference,"As effective
negotiators have long known and psychologists have
repeatedly proved, potential losses loom larger in the human
mind than do similar gains. Getting a good deal may push
us toward making a risky bet, but saving our reputation
from destruction is a much stronger motivation. So what kind of Black Swans do you look to be aware of
as negative leverage? Effective negotiators look for pieces
of information, often obliquely revealed, that show what is
important to their counterpart: Who is their audience? What
signifies status and reputation to them? What most worries
them? To find this information, one method is to go outside
the negotiating table and speak to a third party that knows
your counterpart. The most effective method is to gather it
from interactions with your counterpart. That said, a word of warning: I do not believe in making
direct threats and am extremely careful with even subtle
ones. Threats can be like nuclear bombs.",
3939,Never split the difference,"There will be a
toxic residue that will be difficult to clean up. You have to
handle the potential of negative consequences with care, or
you will hurt yourself and poison or blow up the whole
process. If you shove your negative leverage down your
counterpart’s throat, it might be perceived as you taking
away their autonomy. People will often sooner die than give
up their autonomy. They’ll at least act irrationally and shut
off the negotiation. A more subtle technique is to label your negative
leverage and thereby make it clear without attacking. Sentences like “It seems like you strongly value the fact that
you’ve always paid on time” or “It seems like you don’t
care what position you are leaving me in” can really open
up the negotiation process. NORMATIVE LEVERAGE
Every person has a set of rules and a moral framework. Normative leverage is using the other party’s norms and
standards to advance your position.",
3940,Never split the difference,"If you can show
inconsistencies between their beliefs and their actions, you
have normative leverage. No one likes to look like a
hypocrite. For example, if your counterpart lets slip that they
generally pay a certain multiple of cash flow when they buy
a company, you can frame your desired price in a way that
reflects that valuation. Discovering the Black Swans that give you normative
valuation can be as easy as asking what your counterpart
believes and listening openly. You want to see what
language they speak, and speak it back to them. KNOW THEIR RELIGION
In March 2003 I led the negotiation with a farmer who
became one of the most unlikely post-9/11 terrorists you can
imagine. The drama started when Dwight Watson, a North
Carolina tobacco grower, hooked up his jeep to a John
Deere tractor festooned with banners and an inverted U.S. flag and towed it to Washington, D.C., to protest
government policies he thought were putting tobacco
farmers out of business.",
3941,Never split the difference,"When Watson got to the capital, he pulled his tractor into
a pond between the Washington Monument and the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial and threatened to blow it up
with the “organophosphate” bombs he claimed were inside. The capital went into lockdown as the police blocked off
an eight-block area from the Lincoln Memorial to the
Washington Monument. Coming just months after the
Beltway sniper attacks and alongside the buildup to the Iraq
War, the ease with which Watson threw the nation’s capital
into turmoil freaked people out. Talking on his cell phone, Watson told the Washington
Post that he was on a do-or-die mission to show how
reduced subsidies were killing tobacco farmers. He told the
Post that God had instructed him to stage his protest and he
wasn’t going to leave. “If this is the way America will be run, the hell with it,”
he said. “I will not surrender. They can blow [me] out of the
water.",
3942,Never split the difference,"I’m ready to go to heaven.”
The FBI deployed me to a converted RV on the National
Mall, where I was to guide a team of FBI agents and U.S. Park Police as we tried to talk Watson out of killing himself
and who knows how many others. And then we got down to business. Like you’d expect of a negotiation with a guy
threatening to destroy a good part of the U.S. capital, it was
righteously tense. Sharpshooters had their weapons trained
on Watson, and they had the “green light” to shoot if he
made any crazy moves. In any negotiation, but especially in a tense one like this,
it’s not how well you speak but how well you listen that
determines your success. Understanding the “other” is a
precondition to be able to speak persuasively and develop
options that resonate for them. There is the visible
negotiation and then all the things that are hidden under the
surface (the secret negotiation space wherein the Black
Swans dwell).",
3943,Never split the difference,"Access to this hidden space very often comes through
understanding the other side’s worldview, their reason for
being, their religion. Indeed, digging into your counterpart’s
“religion” (sometimes involving God but not always)
inherently implies moving beyond the negotiating table and
into the life, emotional and otherwise, of your counterpart. Once you’ve understood your counterpart’s worldview,
you can build influence. That’s why as we talked with
Watson I spent my energy trying to unearth who he was
rather than logically arguing him into surrender. From this we learned that Watson had been finding it
increasingly hard to make a living on his 1,200-acre tobacco
farm, which had been in his family for five generations. After being hit by a drought and having his crop quota cut
by half, Watson decided he couldn’t afford the farm
anymore and drove to Washington to make his point. He
wanted attention, and knowing what he wanted gave us
positive leverage.",
3944,Never split the difference,"Watson also told us he was a veteran, and veterans had
rules. This is the kind of music you want to hear, as it
provides normative leverage. He told us that he would be
willing to surrender, but not right away. As a military police
officer in the 82nd Airborne in the 1970s, he’d learned that
if he was trapped behind enemy lines, he could withdraw
with honor if reinforcements didn’t arrive within three days. But not before. Now, we had articulated rules we could hold him to, and
the admission that he could withdraw also implied that,
despite his bluster about dying, he wanted to live. One of
the first things you try to decide in a hostage negotiation is
whether your counterpart’s vision of the future involves
them living. And Watson had answered yes. We used this information—a piece of negative leverage,
as we could take away something he wanted: life—and
started working it alongside the positive leverage of his
desire to be heard.",
3945,Never split the difference,"We emphasized to Watson that he had
already made national news and if he wanted his message to
survive he was going to have to live. Watson was smart enough to understand that there was a
real chance he wouldn’t make it out alive, but he still had
his rules of military honor. His own desires and fears helped
generate some positive and negative leverage, but they were
secondary to the norms by which he lived his life. It was tempting to just wait until the third day, but I
doubted we’d get that far. With each passing hour the
atmosphere was growing tenser. The capital was under siege
and we had reason to believe he might have explosives. If
he made one wrong move, one spastic freak-out, the snipers
would kill him. He’d already had several angry outbursts, so
every hour that passed endangered him. He could still get
himself killed. But we couldn’t hit on that at all; we couldn’t threaten to
kill him and expect that to work.",
3946,Never split the difference,"The reason for that is
something called the “paradox of power”—namely, the
harder we push the more likely we are to be met with
resistance. That’s why you have to use negative leverage
sparingly. Still, time was short and we had to speed things up. But how? What happened next was one of those glorious examples
of how deeply listening to understand your counterpart’s
worldview can reveal a Black Swan that transforms a
negotiation dynamic. Watson didn’t directly tell us what we
needed to know, but by close attention we uncovered a
subtle truth that informed everything he said. About thirty-six hours in, Winnie Miller, an FBI agent on
our team who’d been listening intently to subtle references
Watson had been making, turned to me. “He’s a devout Christian,” she told me. “Tell him
tomorrow is the Dawn of the Third Day. That’s the day
Christians believe Jesus Christ left his tomb and ascended to
Heaven.",
3947,Never split the difference,"If Christ came out on the Dawn of the Third Day,
why not Watson?”
It was a brilliant use of deep listening. By combining that
subtext of Watson’s words with knowledge of his worldview
she let us show Watson that we not only were listening, but
that we had also heard him. If we’d understood his subtext correctly, this would let
him end the standoff honorably and to do so with the feeling
that he was surrendering to an adversary that respected him
and his beliefs. By positioning your demands within the worldview your
counterpart uses to make decisions, you show them respect
and that gets you attention and results. Knowing your
counterpart’s religion is more than just gaining normative
leverage per se. Rather, it’s gaining a holistic understanding
of your counterpart’s worldview—in this case, literally a
religion—and using that knowledge to inform your
negotiating moves. Using your counterpart’s religion is extremely effective
in large part because it has authority over them.",
3948,Never split the difference,"The other
guy’s “religion” is what the market, the experts, God, or
society—whatever matters to him—has determined to be fair
and just. And people defer to that authority. In the next conversation with Watson, we mentioned that
the next morning was the Dawn of the Third Day. There was
a long moment of silence on the other end of the line. Our
Negotiation Operation Center was so quiet you could hear
the heartbeat of the guy next to you. Watson coughed. “I’ll come out,” he said. And he did, ending a forty-eight-hour standoff, saving
himself from harm, and allowing the nation’s capital to
resume its normal life. No explosives were found. While the importance of “knowing their religion” should be
clear from Watson’s story, here are two tips for reading
religion correctly:
■
Review everything you hear. You will not hear
everything the first time, so double-check. Compare notes with your team members. You
will often discover new information that will help
you advance the negotiation.",
3949,Never split the difference,"■
Use backup listeners whose only job is to listen
between the lines. They will hear things you
miss. In other words: listen, listen again, and listen some more. We’ve seen how a holistic understanding of your
counterpart’s “religion”—a huge Black Swan—can provide
normative leverage that leads to negotiating results. But
there are other ways in which learning your counterpart’s
“religion” enables you to achieve better outcomes. THE SIMILARITY PRINCIPLE
Research by social scientists has confirmed something
effective negotiators have known for ages: namely, we trust
people more when we view them as being similar or
familiar. People trust those who are in their in-group. Belonging is
a primal instinct. And if you can trigger that instinct, that
sense that, “Oh, we see the world the same way,” then you
immediately gain influence. When our counterpart displays attitudes, beliefs, ideas—
even modes of dress—that are similar to our own, we tend
to like and trust them more.",
3950,Never split the difference,"Similarities as shallow as club
memberships or college alumni status increase rapport. That’s why in many cultures negotiators spend large
amounts of time building rapport before they even think of
offers. Both sides know that the information they glean
could be vital to effective deal making and leverage
building. It’s a bit like dogs circling each other, smelling
each other’s behind. I once worked a deal for our services with this CEO in
Ohio where the similarity principle played a major role. My counterpart was constantly making references that I
recognized as being sort of born-again Christian material. As we talked he kept going back and forth on whether he
should bring in his advisors. The whole issue of his advisors
clearly pained him; at one point he even said, “Nobody
understands me.”
At that moment I began to rack my brain for the
Christian word that captured the essence of what he was
saying.",
3951,Never split the difference,"And then the term came to my mind, a term people
often used in church to describe the duty one had to
administer our own and our world’s—and therefore God’s—
resources with honesty, accountability, and responsibility. “This is really stewardship for you, isn’t it?” I said. His voice immediately strengthened. “Yes! You’re the only one who understands,” he said. And he hired us at that moment. By showing that I
understood his deeper reasons for being and accessing a
sense of similarity, of mutual belongingness, I was able to
bring him to the deal. The minute I established a kind of
shared identity with this Christian, we were in. Not simply
because 
of 
similarity 
alone, 
but 
because 
of 
the
understanding implied by that moment of similarity. THE POWER OF HOPES AND DREAMS
Once you know your counterpart’s religion and can
visualize what he truly wants out of life, you can employ
those aspirations as a way to get him to follow you.",
3952,Never split the difference,"Every engineer, every executive, every child—all of us
want to believe we are capable of the extraordinary. As
children, our daydreams feature ourselves as primary
players in great moments: an actor winning an Oscar, an
athlete hitting the game-winning shot. As we grow older,
however, our parents, teachers, and friends talk more of
what we can’t and shouldn’t do than what is possible. We
begin to lose faith. But when someone displays a passion for what we’ve
always wanted and conveys a purposeful plan of how to get
there, we allow our perceptions of what’s possible to
change. We’re all hungry for a map to joy, and when
someone is courageous enough to draw it for us, we
naturally follow. So when you ascertain your counterpart’s unattained
goals, invoke your own power and follow-ability by
expressing passion for their goals—and for their ability to
achieve them. Ted Leonsis is great at this.",
3953,Never split the difference,"As the owner of the
Washington Wizards professional basketball team and the
Washington Capitals professional hockey team, he is always
talking about creating the immortal moments in sports that
people will tell their grandchildren about. Who doesn’t want
to come to an agreement with someone who is going to
make them immortal? RELIGION AS A REASON
Research studies have shown that people respond favorably
to requests made in a reasonable tone of voice and followed
with a “because” reason. In a famous study from the late 1970s,3 Harvard
psychology professor Ellen Langer and her colleagues
approached people waiting for copy machines and asked if
they could cut the line. Sometimes they gave a reason;
sometimes they didn’t. What she found was crazy: without
her giving a reason, 60 percent let her through, but when
she did give one, more than 90 percent did. And it didn’t
matter if the reason made sense. (“Excuse me, I have five
pages.",
3954,Never split the difference,"May I cut in line because I have to make copies?”
worked great.) People just responded positively to the
framework. While idiotic reasons worked with something simple like
photocopying, on more complicated issues you can increase
your effectiveness by offering reasons that reference your
counterpart’s religion. Had that Christian CEO offered me a
lowball offer when he agreed to hire my firm, I might have
answered, “I’d love to but I too have a duty to be a
responsible steward of my resources.”
IT’S NOT CRAZY, IT’S A CLUE
It’s not human nature to embrace the unknown. It scares us. When we are confronted by it, we ignore it, we run away, or
we label it in ways that allow us to dismiss it.",
3955,Never split the difference,"In
negotiations, that label most often takes the form of the
statement, “They’re crazy!”
That’s one reason I’ve been highly critical of some of
the implementation of America’s hostage negotiation policy
—which is that we don’t negotiate with those we refer
broadly to as “the Terrorists,” including groups from the
Taliban to ISIS. The rationale for this nonengagement is summarized
well by the journalist Peter Bergen, CNN’s national security
analyst: “Negotiations with religious fanatics who have
delusions of grandeur generally do not go well.”
The alternative we’ve chosen is to not understand their
religion, their fanaticism, and their delusions. Instead of
negotiations that don’t go well, we shrug our shoulders and
say, “They’re crazy!”
But that’s absolutely wrongheaded. We must understand
these things.",
3956,Never split the difference,"I’m not saying that because I’m a softheaded
pacifist (the FBI doesn’t hire agents like that) but because I
know understanding such things is the best way to discover
the other side’s vulnerabilities and wants and thereby gain
influence. You can’t get that stuff unless you talk. No one is immune to “They’re crazy!” You can see it rear
its head in every kind of negotiation, from parenting to
congressional deal making to corporate bargaining. But the moment when we’re most ready to throw our
hands up and declare “They’re crazy!” is often the best
moment for discovering Black Swans that transform a
negotiation. It is when we hear or see something that doesn’t
make sense—something “crazy”—that a crucial fork in the
road is presented: push forward, even more forcefully, into
that which we initially can’t process; or take the other path,
the one to guaranteed failure, in which we tell ourselves that
negotiating was useless anyway.",
3957,Never split the difference,"In their great book Negotiation Genius,4 Harvard
Business School professors Deepak Malhotra and Max H. Bazerman provide a look at the common reasons negotiators
mistakenly call their counterparts crazy. I’d like to talk
through them here. MISTAKE #1: THEY ARE ILL-INFORMED
Often the other side is acting on bad information, and when
people have bad information they make bad choices. There’s a great computer industry term for this: GIGO—
Garbage In, Garbage Out. As an example, Malhotra talks about a student of his
who was in a dispute with an ex-employee who claimed he
was owed $130,000 in commissions for work he had done
before being fired; he was threatening a lawsuit. Confused, the executive turned to the company’s
accountants. There he discovered the problem: the accounts
had been a mess when the employee was fired but had since
been put into order. With the clean information, the
accountants assured the executive that in fact the employee
owed the company $25,000.",
3958,Never split the difference,"Eager to avoid a lawsuit, the executive called the
employee, explained the situation, and made an offer: if the
employee dropped the lawsuit he could keep the $25,000. To his surprise, the employee said that he was going
forward with the suit anyway; he acted irrational, crazy. Malhotra told his student that the problem was not
craziness, but a lack of information and trust. So the
executive had an outside accounting firm audit the numbers
and send the results to the employee. The result? The employee dropped the suit. The clear point here is that people operating with
incomplete information appear crazy to those who have
different information. Your job when faced with someone
like this in a negotiation is to discover what they do not
know and supply that information. MISTAKE #2: THEY ARE CONSTRAINED
In any negotiation where your counterpart is acting wobbly,
there exists a distinct possibility that they have things they
can’t do but aren’t eager to reveal.",
3959,Never split the difference,"Such constraints can
make the sanest counterpart seem irrational. The other side
might not be able to do something because of legal advice,
or because of promises already made, or even to avoid
setting a precedent. Or they may just not have the power to close the deal. That last situation is one that a client of mine faced as he
was trying to land Coca-Cola as a client for his marketing
firm. The guy had been negotiating a deal for months and it
was getting on to November. He was petrified that if he
didn’t close it before the calendar year ended he would have
to wait for Coca-Cola to set a new budget and he might lose
the client. The problem was that his contact had suddenly stopped
responding. So we told him to send a version of our classic
email for nonresponders, the one that always works: “Have
you given up on finalizing this deal this year?”
Then something weird happened. The Coca-Cola contact
didn’t respond to the perfect email. What was up?",
3960,Never split the difference,"This was superficially quite irrational, but the contact
had been a straight-up guy until then. We told our client this
could mean only one thing: that the guy had given up on
closing the deal by the end of the year, but he didn’t want to
admit it. There had to be some constraint. With this knowledge in hand, we had our client dig
deep. After a batch of phone calls and emails he tracked
down someone who knew his contact. And it turned out we
had been right: the contact’s division had been in chaos for
weeks, and in the midst of corporate infighting he had
completely lost influence. Not surprisingly, he was
embarrassed to admit it. That’s why he was avoiding my
client. To put it simply, he had major constraints. MISTAKE #3: THEY HAVE OTHER INTERESTS
Think back to William Griffin, the first man ever to kill a
hostage on deadline. What the FBI and police negotiators on the scene simply
did not know was that his main interest was not negotiating
a deal to release the hostages for money.",
3961,Never split the difference,"He wanted to be
killed by a cop. Had they been able to dig up that hidden
interest, they might have been able to avoid some of that
day’s tragedy. The presence of hidden interests isn’t as rare as you
might think. Your counterpart will often reject offers for
reasons that have nothing to do with their merits. A client may put off buying your product so that their
calendar year closes before the invoice hits, increasing his
chance for a promotion. Or an employee might quit in the
middle of a career-making project, just before bonus season,
because he or she has learned that colleagues are making
more money. For that employee, fairness is as much an
interest as money. Whatever the specifics of the situation, these people are
not acting irrationally. They are simply complying with
needs and desires that you don’t yet understand, what the
world looks like to them based on their own set of rules. Your job is to bring these Black Swans to light.",
3962,Never split the difference,"As we’ve seen, when you recognize that your counterpart is
not irrational, but simply ill-informed, constrained, or
obeying interests that you do not yet know, your field of
movement greatly expands. And that allows you to
negotiate much more effectively. Here are a few ways to unearth these powerful Black
Swans:
GET FACE TIME
Black Swans are incredibly hard to uncover if you’re not
literally at the table. No matter how much research you do, there’s just some
information that you are not going to find out unless you sit
face-to-face. Today, a lot of younger people do almost everything
over email. It’s just how things are done. But it’s very
difficult to find Black Swans with email for the simple
reason that, even if you knock your counterpart off their
moorings with great labels and calibrated questions, email
gives them too much time to think and re-center themselves
to avoid revealing too much.",
3963,Never split the difference,"In addition, email doesn’t allow for tone-of-voice effects,
and it doesn’t let you read the nonverbal parts of your
counterpart’s response (remember 7-38-55). Let’s return now to the tale of my client who was trying
to get Coca-Cola as a client, only to learn that his contact at
the company had been pushed aside. I realized that the only way my client was going to get a
deal with Coca-Cola was by getting his contact to admit that
he was useless for the situation and pass my client on to the
correct executive. But there was no way this guy wanted to
do that, because he still imagined that he could be
important. So I told my client to get his contact out of the Coca-
Cola complex. “You got to get him to dinner.",
3964,Never split the difference,"You’re going
to say, ‘Would it be a bad idea for me to take you to your
favorite steak house and we just have a few laughs, and we
don’t talk business?’”
The idea was that no matter the reason—whether the
contact was embarrassed, or didn’t like my client, or just
didn’t want to discuss the situation—the only way the
process was going to move forward was through direct
human interaction. So my client got this guy out for dinner and as promised
he didn’t bring up business. But there was no way not to
talk about it, and just because my client created personal,
face-to-face interaction, the contact admitted he was the
wrong guy. He admitted that his division was a mess and
he’d have to hand things off to somebody else to get the
deal done. And he did. It took more than a year to get the deal
signed, but they did it.",
3965,Never split the difference,"OBSERVE UNGUARDED MOMENTS
While you have to get face time, formal business meetings,
structured encounters, and planned negotiating sessions are
often the least revealing kinds of face time because these are
the moments when people are at their most guarded. Hunting for Black Swans is also effective during
unguarded moments at the fringes, whether at meals like my
client had with his Coca-Cola contact, or the brief moments
of relaxation before or after formal interactions. During a typical business meeting, the first few minutes,
before you actually get down to business, and the last few
moments, as everyone is leaving, often tell you more about
the other side than anything in between. That’s why
reporters have a credo to never turn off their recorders: you
always get the best stuff at the beginning and the end of an
interview. Also pay close attention to your counterpart during
interruptions, odd exchanges, or anything that interrupts the
flow.",
3966,Never split the difference,"When someone breaks ranks, people’s façades crack
just a little. Simply noticing whose cracks and how others
respond verbally and nonverbally can reveal a gold mine. WHEN IT DOESN’T MAKE SENSE, THERE’S CENTS
TO BE MADE
Students often ask me whether Black Swans are specific
kinds of information or any kind that helps. I always answer
that they are anything that you don’t know that changes
things. To drive this home, here’s the story of one of my MBA
students who was interning for a private equity real estate
firm in Washington. Faced with actions from his counterpart
that didn’t pass the sense test, he innocently turned up one
of the greatest Black Swans I’ve seen in years by using a
label. My student had been performing due diligence on
potential targets when a principal at the firm asked him to
look into a mixed-use property in the heart of Charleston,
South Carolina.",
3967,Never split the difference,"He had no experience in the Charleston
market, so he called the broker selling the property and
requested the marketing package. After discussing the deal and the market, my student and
his boss decided that the asking price of $4.3 million was
about $450,000 too high. At that point, my student called
the broker again to discuss pricing and next steps. After initial pleasantries, the broker asked my student
what he thought of the property. “It looks like an interesting property,” he said. “Unfortunately, we don’t know the market fundamentals. We like downtown and King Street in particular, but we
have a lot of questions.”
The broker then told him that he had been in the market
for more than fifteen years, so he was well informed. At this
point, my student pivoted to calibrated “How” and
“What” questions in order to gather information and judge
the broker’s skills. “Great,” my student said.",
3968,Never split the difference,"“First and foremost, how has
Charleston been affected by the economic downturn?”
The broker replied with a detailed answer, citing specific
examples of market improvement. In the process, he
showed my student that he was very knowledgeable. “It sounds like I’m in good hands!” he said, using a
label to build empathy. “Next question: What sort of cap
rate can be expected in this type of building?”
Through the ensuing back-and-forth, my student learned
that owners could expect rates of 6 to 7 percent because
buildings like this were popular with students at the local
university, a growing school where 60 percent of the student
body lived off campus. He also learned that it would be prohibitively expensive
—if not physically impossible—to buy land nearby and
build a similar building. In the last five years no one had
built on the street because of historic preservation rules. Even if they could buy land, the broker said a similar
building would cost $2.5 million just in construction.",
3969,Never split the difference,"“The building is in great shape, especially compared to
the other options available to students,” the broker said. “It seems like this building functions more as a glorified
dormitory than a classic multifamily building,” my student
said, using a label to extract more information. And he got it. “Fortunately and unfortunately, yes,” the broker said. “The occupancy has historically been one hundred percent
and it is a cash cow, but the students act like college
students . . .”
A lightbulb went on in my student’s head: there was
something strange afoot. If it were such a cash cow, why
would someone sell a 100 percent occupied building
located next to a growing campus in an affluent city? That
was irrational by any measure. A little befuddled but still in
the negotiation mindset, my student constructed a label. Inadvertently he mislabeled the situation, triggering the
broker to correct him and reveal a Black Swan.",
3970,Never split the difference,"“If he or she is selling such a cash cow, it seems like the
seller must have doubts about future market fundamentals,”
he said. “Well,” he said, “the seller has some tougher properties
in Atlanta and Savannah, so he has to get out of this
property to pay back the other mortgages.”
Bingo! With that, my student had unearthed a fantastic
Black Swan. The seller was suffering constraints that, until
that moment, had been unknown. My student put the broker on mute as he described other
properties and used the moment to discuss pricing with his
boss. He quickly gave him the green light to make a
lowball offer—an extreme anchor—to try to yank the
broker to his minimum. After quizzing the broker if the seller would be willing to
close quickly, and getting a “yes,” my student set his
anchor. “I think I have heard enough,” he said. “We are willing
to offer $3.4 million.”
“Okay,” the broker answered. “That is well below the
asking price.",
3971,Never split the difference,"However, I can bring the offer to the seller and
see what he thinks.”
Later that day, the broker came back with a counteroffer. The seller had told him that the number was too low, but he
was willing to take $3.7 million. My student could barely
keep from falling off his chair; the counteroffer was lower
than his goal. But rather than jump at the amount—and risk
leaving value on the table with a wimp-win deal—my
student pushed further. He said “No” without using the
word. “That is closer to what we believe the value to be,” he
said, “but we cannot in good conscience pay more than
$3.55 million.”
(Later, my student told me—and I agreed—that he
should have used a label or calibrated question here to
push the broker to bid against himself.",
3972,Never split the difference,"But he was so
surprised by how far the price had dropped that he stumbled
into old-school haggling.)
“I am only authorized to go down to $3.6 million,” the
broker answered, clearly showing that he’d never taken a
negotiation class that taught the Ackerman model and how
to pivot to terms to avoid the haggle. My student’s boss signaled to him that $3.6 million
worked and he agreed to the price. I’ve teased several of the techniques my student used to
effectively negotiate a great deal for his firm, from the use
of labels and calibrated questions to the probing of
constraints to unearth a beautiful Black Swan. It also
bears noting that my student did tons of work beforehand
and had prepared labels and questions so that he was ready
to jump on the Black Swan when the broker offered it. Once he knew that the seller was trying to get money out
of 
this 
building 
to 
pay 
off 
mortgages 
on 
the
underperforming ones, he knew that timing was important.",
3973,Never split the difference,"Of course, there’s always room for improvement. Afterward my student told me he wished he hadn’t
lowballed the offer so quickly and instead used the
opportunity to discuss the other properties. He might have
found more investment opportunities within the seller’s
portfolio. In addition, he could have potentially built more
empathy and teased out more unknown unknowns with
labels or calibrated questions like “What markets are you
finding difficult right now?” Maybe even gotten face time
with the seller directly. Still, well done! OVERCOMING FEAR AND LEARNING TO GET
WHAT YOU WANT OUT OF LIFE
People generally fear conflict, so they avoid useful
arguments out of fear that the tone will escalate into
personal attacks they cannot handle. People in close
relationships often avoid making their own interests known
and instead compromise across the board to avoid being
perceived as greedy or self-interested. They fold, they grow
bitter, and they grow apart.",
3974,Never split the difference,"We’ve all heard of marriages
that ended in divorce and the couple never fought. Families are just an extreme version of all parts of
humanity, from government to business. Except for a few
naturals, everyone hates negotiation at first. Your hands
sweat, your fight-or-flight kicks in (with a strong emphasis
o n flight), and your thoughts trip drunkenly over
themselves. The natural first impulse for most of us is to chicken out,
throw in the towel, run. The mere idea of tossing out an
extreme anchor is traumatic. That’s why wimp-win deals are
the norm in the kitchen and in the boardroom. But stop and think about that. Are we really afraid of the
guy across the table? I can promise you that, with very few
exceptions, he’s not going to reach across and slug you. No, our sweaty palms are just an expression of
physiological fear, a few trigger-happy neurons firing
because of something more base: our innate human desire to
get along with other members of the tribe.",
3975,Never split the difference,"It’s not the guy
across the table who scares us: it’s conflict itself. If this book accomplishes only one thing, I hope it gets
you over that fear of conflict and encourages you to
navigate it with empathy. If you’re going to be great at
anything—a great negotiator, a great manager, a great
husband, a great wife—you’re going to have to do that. You’re going to have to ignore that little genie who’s telling
you to give up, to just get along—as well as that other genie
who’s telling you to lash out and yell. You’re going to have to embrace regular, thoughtful
conflict as the basis of effective negotiation—and of life. Please remember that our emphasis throughout the book is
that the adversary is the situation and that the person that
you appear to be in conflict with is actually your partner. More than a little research has shown that genuine,
honest conflict between people over their goals actually
helps 
energize 
the 
problem-solving 
process 
in 
a
collaborative way.",
3976,Never split the difference,"Skilled negotiators have a talent for using
conflict to keep the negotiation going without stumbling into
a personal battle. Remember, pushing hard for what you believe is not
selfish. It is not bullying. It is not just helping you. Your
amygdala, the part of the brain that processes fear, will try to
convince you to give up, to flee, because the other guy is
right, or you’re being cruel. But if you are an honest, decent person looking for a
reasonable outcome, you can ignore the amygdala. With the style of negotiation taught in the book—an
information-obsessed, empathic search for the best possible
deal—you are trying to uncover value, period. Not to
strong-arm or to humiliate. When you ask calibrated questions, yes, you are leading
your counterpart to your goals. But you are also leading
them to examine and articulate what they want and why and
how they can achieve it. You are demanding creativity of
them, and therefore pushing them toward a collaborative
solution.",
3977,Never split the difference,"When I bought my red 4Runner, no doubt I disappointed
the salesman by giving him a smaller payday than he would
have liked. But I helped him reach his quota, and no doubt I
paid more for the truck than the car lot had paid Toyota. If
all I’d wanted was to “win,” to humiliate, I would have
stolen the thing. And so I’m going to leave you with one request:
Whether it’s in the office or around the family dinner table,
don’t avoid honest, clear conflict. It will get you the best car
price, the higher salary, and the largest donation. It will also
save your marriage, your friendship, and your family. One can only be an exceptional negotiator, and a great
person, by both listening and speaking clearly and
empathetically; by treating counterparts—and oneself—with
dignity and respect; and most of all by being honest about
what one wants and what one can—and cannot—do.",
3978,Never split the difference,"Every
negotiation, every conversation, every moment of life, is a
series of small conflicts that, managed well, can rise to
creative beauty. Embrace them. KEY LESSONS
What we don’t know can kill us or our deals. But
uncovering it can totally change the course of a negotiation
and bring us unexpected success. Finding the Black Swans—those powerful unknown
unknowns—is intrinsically difficult, however, for the simple
reason that we don’t know the questions to ask. Because we
don’t know what the treasure is, we don’t know where to
dig. Here are some of the best techniques for flushing out the
Black Swans—and exploiting them. Remember, your
counterpart might not even know how important the
information is, or even that they shouldn’t reveal it. So keep
pushing, probing, and gathering information. ■
Let 
what 
you 
know—your known knowns
—guide you but not blind you. Every case is
new, 
so 
remain 
flexible 
and 
adaptable.",
3979,Never split the difference,"Remember the Griffin bank crisis: no hostage-
taker had killed a hostage on deadline, until he
did. ■
Black Swans are leverage multipliers. Remember
the three types of leverage: positive (the ability to
give someone what they want); negative (the
ability to hurt someone); and normative (using
your counterpart’s norms to bring them around). ■
Work to understand the other side’s “religion.”
Digging into worldviews inherently implies
moving beyond the negotiating table and into the
life, 
emotional 
and 
otherwise, 
of 
your
counterpart. That’s where Black Swans live. ■
Review 
everything 
you 
hear 
from 
your
counterpart. You will not hear everything the
first time, so double-check. Compare notes with
team members. Use backup listeners whose job
is to listen between the lines. They will hear
things you miss. ■
Exploit the similarity principle.",
3980,Never split the difference,"People are more
apt to concede to someone they share a cultural
similarity with, so dig for what makes them tick
and show that you share common ground. ■
When someone seems irrational or crazy, they
most likely aren’t. Faced with this situation,
search for constraints, hidden desires, and bad
information. ■
Get face time with your counterpart. Ten minutes
of face time often reveals more than days of
research. Pay 
special 
attention 
to 
your
counterpart’s 
verbal 
and 
nonverbal
communication at unguarded moments—at the
beginning and the end of the session or when
someone says something out of line. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This book would not have been possible without my son
Brandon’s help. Brandon has been involved in helping me
shape and create these ideas since I first began teaching at
Georgetown University. He was initially just there to video-
record the classes but he also provided me feedback on how
it was going and what was working.",
3981,Never split the difference,"To be fair, he actually
has been negotiating with me since he was two years old. I
think I’ve known that ever since I found out he was using
empathy to get out of trouble with his vice-principal in high
school. In my first meeting with my brilliant cowriter, Tahl
Raz, Brandon was there to keep the information flow going
as Tahl soaked it up. In the first progress conference call
with my amazing publisher, Hollis Heimbouch, Hollis asked
about Brandon’s role and Tahl said having Brandon around
was like having another Chris in the room. Brandon has
been indispensable. Tahl Raz is a flat-out genius. Anyone who writes a
business book without him hasn’t gotten as far as they could
have. It’s that simple. I can’t believe how smart he is or how
quickly he gets it. He is a true business-writing artist. He’s a
great person as well. Steve Ross, my agent, is a man of integrity and was
perfect for this book. He has great industry knowledge and
made this book happen. I am grateful to know him.",
3982,Never split the difference,"Hollis Heimbouch rocks! I am thrilled that she led the
HarperCollins team and believed enough in this book to buy
it. Thank you, Hollis. Thank you, Maya Stevenson, for coming onto the Black
Swan team and holding us together. We are going farther
because of you. Sheila Heen and John Richardson are two amazing
people. They are the ones who really paved the way to show
that these hostage negotiation ideas belong in the business
world. Sheila was my teacher at Harvard Law School. She
inspired me with how she taught and who she is. She asked
me to teach alongside her two years later. John asked me to
teach International Business Negotiation at Harvard
alongside him a year after that. He guided me through that
process, which led to the opportunity to become an adjunct
at Georgetown. When nothing was happening for me, both
John and Sheila were there. Without them I don’t know
where I’d be. Thank you both. Gary Noesner was my mentor at the FBI.",

and remade the hostage negotiation world (with the help of
his team at the Crisis Negotiation Unit—CNU). He
supported me in whatever I wanted to do. He made me the
FBI’s lead international kidnapping negotiator. I could call
Gary at five a.m. and tell him I was getting on a plane in
three hours to go to a kidnapping and he would say, “Go.”
His support never wavered. At CNU he pulled together the
most talented collection of hostage negotiators ever
assembled. CNU hit its zenith when we were there. None of
us knew how lucky we were. John Flood, Vince Dalfonzo,
Chuck Regini, Winnie Miller, Manny Suarez, Dennis
Braiden, Neil Purtell, and Steve Romano were all rock stars. I learned from you all. I can’t believe what Chuck put up
with from me as my partner. Dennis was a mentor and great
friend. I constantly clashed with Vince and grew because of
his talent. All those who were on the FBI Critical Incident
Negotiation Team during that time taught me as well. Thank
you.",
3984,Never split the difference,"Tommy Corrigan and John Liguori were my brothers
when I was in New York City. The three of us did
extraordinary things together. I am inspired by the memory
of Tommy Corrigan to this day. I was privileged to be a
member of the Joint Terrorist Task Force. We fought evil. Richie DeFilippo and Charlie Beaudoin were exceptional
wingmen on the Crisis Negotiation Team. Thank you both
for all you taught me. Hugh McGowan and Bob Louden from the NYPD’s
Hostage Negotiation Team shared their wisdom with me. Both of you have been indispensable assets to the hostage
negotiation world. Thank you. Derek Gaunt has been a great wingman in the
Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. Derek gets it. Thank
you, Derek. Kathy Ellingsworth and her late husband, Bill,
have been dear friends and a sounding board for years. I am
grateful for your support and friendship. Tom Strentz is the godfather of the FBI’s hostage/crisis
negotiation program and has been an unwavering friend.",
3985,Never split the difference,"I
can’t believe he still takes my calls. My students at Georgetown and USC have constantly
proved that these ideas work everywhere. More than one
student has stopped breathing when I looked at them and
said, “I need a car in sixty seconds or she dies.” Thanks for
coming along for the ride. Georgetown and USC have both
been phenomenal places to teach. Both are truly dedicated
to higher learning, the highest academic standards, and the
success of their students. The hostages and their families who allowed me in
during their darkest hours to try to help are all blessed
people. I am grateful to still be in touch with some of you
today. What wisdom there is in the universe that decided
your paths were necessary, I don’t understand. I was blessed
by your grace. (I need all the help I can get.)
APPENDIX
PREPARE A NEGOTIATION ONE
SHEET
Negotiation is a psychological investigation.",
3986,Never split the difference,"You can gain
a measure of confidence going into such an investigation
with a simple preparatory exercise we advise all our clients
to do. Basically, it’s a list of the primary tools you anticipate
using, such as labels and calibrated questions, customized to
the particular negotiation. When the pressure is on, you don’t rise to the occasion
—you fall to your highest level of preparation. One note of caution before going into greater depth on
this exercise: some negotiation experts fetishize preparation
to such a degree that they advise people to create the
equivalent of preordained scripts for exactly how the
negotiation will unfold and the exact form and substance the
agreement will take on. By now, after reading this far, you’ll
understand why that’s a fool’s errand. Not only will such an
approach make you less agile and creative at the table, it
will make you more susceptible to those who are.",
3987,Never split the difference,"Based on my company’s experiences, I believe that
good initial preparation for each negotiation yields at least a
7:1 rate of return on time saved renegotiating deals or
clarifying implementation. In the entertainment industry, they have a single
document that summarizes a product for publicity and sales
that they call a “one sheet.” Along the same lines, we want
to produce a negotiation “one sheet” that summarizes the
tools we are going to use. It will have five short sections
SECTION I: THE GOAL
Think through best/worst-case scenarios but only write
down a specific goal that represents the best case. Typically, negotiation experts will tell you to prepare by
making a list: your bottom line; what you really want; how
you’re going to try to get there; and counters to your
counterpart’s arguments. But this typical preparation fails in many ways. It’s
unimaginative and leads to the predictable bargaining
dynamic of offer/counteroffer/meet in the middle.",
3988,Never split the difference,"In other
words, it gets results, but they’re often mediocre. The centerpiece of the traditional preparation dynamic—
and its greatest Achilles’ heel—is something called the
BATNA. Roger Fisher and William Ury coined the term in their
1981 bestseller, Getting to Yes, and it stands for Best
Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement. Basically, it’s the
best possible option you have if negotiations fail. Your last
resort. Say you’re on a car lot trying to sell your old BMW
3-series. If you already have another dealer who’s given
you a written offer for $10,000, that’s your BATNA. The problem is that BATNA tricks negotiators into
aiming low. Researchers have found that humans have a
limited capacity for keeping focus in complex, stressful
situations like negotiations. And so, once a negotiation is
under way, we tend to gravitate toward the focus point that
has the most psychological significance for us.",
3989,Never split the difference,"In that context, obsessing over a BATNA turns it into
your target, and thereby sets the upper limit of what you will
ask for. After you’ve spent hours on a BATNA, you
mentally concede everything beyond it. God knows aiming low is seductive. Self-esteem is a
huge factor in negotiation, and many people set modest
goals to protect it. It’s easier to claim victory when you aim
low. That’s why some negotiation experts say that many
people who think they have “win-win” goals really have a
“wimp-win” mentality. The “wimp-win” negotiator focuses
on his or her bottom line, and that’s where they end up. So if BATNA isn’t your centerpiece, what should be? I tell my clients that as part of their preparation they
should think about the outcome extremes: best and worst. If
you’ve got both ends covered, you’ll be ready for anything.",
3990,Never split the difference,"So know what you cannot accept and have an idea about the
best-case outcome, but keep in mind that since there’s
information yet to be acquired from the other side, it’s quite
possible that best case might be even better than you know. Remember, never be so sure of what you want that you
wouldn’t take something better. Once you’ve got flexibility
in the forefront of your mind you come into a negotiation
with a winning mindset. Let’s say you’re selling old speakers because you need
$100 to put toward a new set. If you concentrate on the
$100 minimum, you’ll relax when you hear that number and
that’s what you’ll get. But if you know that they are for sale
in used audio stores for $140, you could set a high-end goal
of $150, while remaining open to better things.",
3991,Never split the difference,"Now, while I counsel thinking about a best/worst range
to give my clients the security of some structure, when it
comes to what actually goes on your one sheet, my advice is
to just stick with the high-end goal, as it will motivate and
focus your psychological powers, priming you to think you
are facing a “loss” for any term that falls short. Decades of
goal-setting research is clear that people who set specific,
challenging, but realistic goals end up getting better deals
than those who don’t set goals or simply strive to do their
best. Bottom line: People who expect more (and articulate it)
get more. Here are the four steps for setting your goal:
■
Set an optimistic but reasonable goal and define
it clearly. ■
Write it down. ■
Discuss your goal with a colleague (this makes it
harder to wimp out). ■
Carry the written goal into the negotiation. SECTION II: SUMMARY
Summarize and write out in just a couple of sentences the
known facts that have led up to the negotiation.",
3992,Never split the difference,"You’re going to have to have something to talk about
beyond a self-serving assessment of what you want. And
you had better be ready to respond with tactical empathy to
your counterpart’s arguments; unless they’re incompetent,
the other party will come prepared to argue an interpretation
of the facts that favors them. Get on the same page at the outset. You have to clearly describe the lay of the land before
you can think about acting in its confines. Why are you
there? What do you want? What do they want? Why? You must be able to summarize a situation in a way that
your counterpart will respond with a “That’s right.” If they
don’t, you haven’t done it right. SECTION III: LABELS/ACCUSATION AUDIT
Prepare three to five labels to perform an accusation audit. Anticipate how your counterpart feels about these facts
you’ve just summarized. Make a concise list of any
accusations they might make—no matter how unfair or
ridiculous they might be.",
3993,Never split the difference,"Then turn each accusation into a
list of no more than five labels and spend a little time role-
playing it. There are fill-in-the-blank labels that can be used in
nearly every situation to extract information from your
counterpart, or defuse an accusation:
It seems like _________ is valuable to you. It seems like you don’t like _________. It seems like you value __________. It seems like _________ makes it easier. It seems like you’re reluctant to _________. As an example, if you’re trying to renegotiate an
apartment lease to allow subletters and you know the
landlord is opposed to them, your prepared labels would be
on the lines of “It seems as though you’re not a fan of
subletters” or “It seems like you want stability with your
tenants.”
SECTION IV: CALIBRATED QUESTIONS
Prepare three to five calibrated questions to reveal value to
you and your counterpart and identify and overcome
potential deal killers.",
3994,Never split the difference,"Effective negotiators look past their counterparts’ stated
positions (what the party demands) and delve into their
underlying motivations (what is making them want what
they want). Motivations are what they are worried about and
what they hope for, even lust for. Figuring out what the other party is worried about
sounds simple, but our basic human expectations about
negotiation often get in the way. Most of us tend to assume
that the needs of the other side conflict with our own. We
tend to limit our field of vision to our issues and problems,
and forget that the other side has its own unique issues
based on its own unique worldview. Great negotiators get
past these blinders by being relentlessly curious about what
is really motivating the other side. Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling has a great quote that
sums up this concept: “You must accept the reality of other
people. You think that reality is up for negotiation, that we
think it’s whatever you say it is.",
3995,Never split the difference,"You must accept that we
are as real as you are; you must accept that you are not
God.”
There will be a small group of “What” and “How”
questions that you will find yourself using in nearly every
situation. Here are a few of them:
What are we trying to accomplish? How is that worthwhile? What’s the core issue here? How does that affect things? What’s the biggest challenge you face? How does this fit into what the objective is? QUESTIONS TO IDENTIFY BEHIND-THE-TABLE
DEAL KILLERS
When implementation happens by committee, the support of
that committee is key. You’ll want to tailor your calibrated
questions to identify and unearth the motivations of those
behind the table, including:
How does this affect the rest of your team? How on board are the people not on this call? What do your colleagues see as their main challenges in
this area?",
3996,Never split the difference,"QUESTIONS TO IDENTIFY AND DIFFUSE DEAL-
KILLING ISSUES
Internal negotiating influence often sits with the people who
are most comfortable with things as they are. Change may
make them look as if they haven’t been doing their job. Your dilemma in such a negotiation is how to make them
look good in the face of that change. You’ll be tempted to concentrate on money, but put that
aside for now. A surprisingly high percentage of
negotiations hinge on something outside dollars and cents. Often they have more to do with self-esteem, status,
autonomy, and other nonfinancial needs. Think about their perceived losses. Never forget that a
loss stings at least twice as much as an equivalent gain. For example, the guy across the table may be hesitating
to install the new accounting system he needs (and you are
selling) because he doesn’t want to screw anything up
before his annual review in four months’ time.",
3997,Never split the difference,"Instead of
lowering your price, you can offer to help impress his boss,
and do it safely, by promising to finish the installation in
ninety days, guaranteed. QUESTIONS TO USE TO UNEARTH THE DEAL-
KILLING ISSUES
What are we up against here? What is the biggest challenge you face? How does making a deal with us affect things? What happens if you do nothing? What does doing nothing cost you? How does making this deal resonate with what your
company prides itself on? It’s often very effective to ask these in groups of two or
three as they are similar enough that they help your
counterpart think about the same thing from different
angles. Every situation is unique, of course, but choosing the
right mix of these questions will lead your counterpart to
reveal information about what they want and need—and
simultaneously push them to see things from your point of
view. Be ready to execute follow-up labels to their answers to
your calibrated questions.",
3998,Never split the difference,"Having labels prepared will allow you to quickly turn
your counterpart’s responses back to them, which will keep
them feeding you new and expanding information. Again,
these are fill-in-the-blank labels that you can use quickly
without tons of thought:
It seems like __________ is important. It seems you feel like my company is in a unique position
to __________. It seems like you are worried that __________. SECTION V: NONCASH OFFERS
Prepare a list of noncash items possessed by your
counterpart that would be valuable. Ask yourself: “What could they give that would almost
get us to do it for free?” Think of the anecdote I told a few
chapters ago about my work for the lawyers’ association:
My counterpart’s interest was to pay me as little cash as
possible in order to look good in front of his board. We
came upon the idea that they pay in part by publishing a
cover story about me in their magazine. That was low-cost
for them and it advanced my interests considerably.",
