Observe: se tiver ativado a integração do Google Search Console , verá métricas adicionais da sua Conta do Google. Métricas na ferramenta de SEO Verá algumas destas métricas quando estiver a pesquisar novos tópicos para criar. Também pode ver estas métricas para um tópico ou subtópico específico que tenha criado: Volume de pesquisa mensal é calculado utilizando a SEMrush e é a média de pesquisas mensais para uma palavra-chave nos motores de busca. Deve procurar tópicos e subtópicos que já estejam a gerar volume mensal, mas tenha em mente que algumas destas frases podem ser difíceis de classificar. Dificuldade é uma estimativa da dificuldade que terá de enfrentar para aparecer na primeira página dos resultados de pesquisa para este tópico. Esta pontuação é medida numa escala de 100 pontos, o que significa que é mais fácil ver o sucesso com palavras-chave que têm pontuações mais baixas. Porque é que as minhas métricas de validação dizem Nenhum dado ? Se as métricas de validação de palavras-chave do subtópico não forem preenchidas com quaisquer dados, as possíveis razões incluem: A SEMRush não tem quaisquer dados para esta métrica. A SEMRush fornece à HubSpot dados nulos, mesmo quando a sua própria aplicação mostra dados. Isso geralmente resolve por si só. Os dados relacionados ao volume de pesquisa mensal são armazenados em cache por 30 dias, portanto, os resultados podem não ser atualizados. O tópico é definido para um país que não tem qualquer volume de pesquisa para o tópico. Por exemplo, se você tiver um tópico específico do idioma, mas o tópico estiver configurado para um país que não fala esse idioma, talvez você não tenha dados de pesquisa.

637,Add a custom SSL certificate to your account,"By default, when you connect a domain to your account, HubSpot automatically provisions a standard SAN SSL certificate through Google Trust Services. However, if you'd prefer to use a different provisioner or type of certificate, you can add custom SSL certificates to your account by purchasing the custom SSL add-on. Please note: HubSpot is not a certificate authority and does not issue SSL certificates. To use a custom SSL certificate, you will need to purchase an SSL certificate from a certificate authority in addition to purchasing the custom SSL add-on. For security reasons, you cannot use an existing custom SSL certificate. To use a custom SSL certificate for your HubSpot website, HubSpot must generate a new certificate signing request (CSR). Types of custom SSL certificates Before purchasing the HubSpot custom SSL certificate add-on, you'll need to decide what type of certificate you want, and the type of validation you require. The type of custom SSL certificate you need depends on how many domains you'll be hosting on it: Single hostname: can be applied to one subdomain. This would be a good option if you'll only be hosting content on www.yourwebsite.com . Wildcard: can be applied to one domain with infinite subdomains. This would be a good option if you'll be hosting content on multiple subdomains, such as www.yourwebsite.com , blog.yourwebsite.com , and info.yourwebsite.com . Multi-domain: can be applied to up to 99 domains. This would be a good option if you'll be hosting content on multiple domains, such as www.yourwebsite.com and www.newbrand.com . Custom SSL certificates can use any of the following types of validation: Domain validated (DV): the certificate authority (CA) validates the certificate using only the domain name. This is the most common type of validation, and is what HubSpot uses for its default SSL certificates. Organization validated (OV): the CA validates the certificate by verifying the business that's requesting the certificate. This requires more validation than DV certificates, but provides another layer of trust. Extended validation (EV): the CA validates the certificate through a series of additional documents and authorizations. This is the highest level of trust and requires several steps to complete validation. Learn more about the types of certificates and validations that are available . Once you've decided the type of certificate and validation, you can begin the process within HubSpot. Please note: before you can add a certificate to a domain, you must first connect the domain to your account . Add a custom certificate To add a custom certificate to your account: In your HubSpot account, click the settings settings icon in the top navigation bar. In the left sidebar menu, navigate to Content > Domains & URLs . Click the Custom SSL tab. Click Add a Custom SSL certificate to add a custom certificate. If you haven't yet purchased the add-on, you'll be guided through the purchase process. In the dialog box, select the type of SSL certificate you'll be using. Then click Add certificate . You'll then be guided through the processes of entering the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) details. Generate the CSR CSR details must be completed in HubSpot before you can request the certificate from the certificate authority. Click the Select a domain dropdown menu and select a domain , then click Next . To add a multi-domain certificate: Click the Select a domain dropdown menu and select one of the domains you're applying the certificate to. On the next screen, enter in any additional domains that you'll be applying the certificate to, separated by commas. You can include domains you've connected to HubSpot or any other external domains. You won't be able to add domains to this list later. Enter the details of the certificate, then click Next : Click the Key length dropdown menu and select a key length , either 1024 or 2048 (recommended). Click the Country code dropdown menu and select your country code . This will be the country code that appears on your certificate. Enter your State or province name , City , Company name , and Department if applicable, in the relevant fields. These details will appear on your certificate. Review the requirements for your custom SSL certificate, then click Next : In the third party SSL process, Cloudflare generates the private key and CSR used for the creation of the certificate. The private key is not shared with HubSpot or any third parties. Customers assume full responsibility for submitting the CSR to the certificate authority. Prior to certificate expiration, HubSpot will notify the customer and extend a CSR to them for signing. The customer is responsible for the subsequent renewal of the third party certificate per the same provisioning process originally followed. Customers must procure their certificate with unlimited server volume terms. Failure to properly license a certificate for Cloudflare server volume may constitute a license infringement with the issuing certificate authority and serve as grounds for revocation of the certificate Download the CSR With the CSR generated, you can now download it to send to your certificate authority of choice. Review the CSR details in the left pane to confirm that your details are correct. Download your CSR, then click Next : To download the certificate request as a .csr file, click Download as .csr . To copy the certificate request as text, click Copy as Text . With your CSR generated, you can bring it to the certificate authority that you're purchasing the certificate from. The CA will then provide an SSL certificate which you can upload to HubSpot. It can take some time for the certificate to be provisioned, so you can continue the process later once your certificate is ready. Click I'll continue later to exit the process. You can then later navigate back to this step once your certificate is ready.

On the next screen, review your full certificate details, then click Submit . If you need to made changes to your certificate details: Click No . To upload a new certificate, select Upload a revised certificate . You'll need to work with the certificate authority to edit any incorrect details before you can upload to HubSpot. Click Next to navigate back to the Upload certificate step of the process. To start over and generate a new CSR that you can bring to the certificate authority, click Generate a new CSR . Click Next to navigate back to the first step of the process . Processing After submitting your SSL certificate, you'll be brought to the Custom SSL section in the Domains & URLs settings page.

For example, you may see data change if HubSpot is able to merge sessions or if contacts' original sources are updated . Customize and filter report data While on any of the report in the web traffic analytics tool, you can change the report's date range and frequency, export and save the report, and filter data by specific analytics views . Any filtering you add, such as date range, will apply to both the chart visualization and the raw data table. To filter the data by time range and frequency, use the Date range and Frequency dropdown menus in the right sidebar. If you select a rolling date range, the data set will exclude the current day. A week in the report starts on Sunday by default, when the date range selected consists of a week, or when the frequency is set to Weekly . Please note: when using a date filter, reports will only display traffic data that occurred during the selected time frame. For example, a page that has not had any visits in the past month will not appear in the pages report when filtering for Last month . In the right sidebar, use the dropdown menus to filter the data that is displayed in your report. In the Additional filters section, click + Add filter to add filters related to the data.

Pages The Pages report shows your content's performance using key traffic metrics . By default, you'll see data for all of your HubSpot pages. The New contacts metric in this report includes all contacts created from form submissions. Please note: The Pages report shows historical data for every URL that has ever been crawled or received a view. If a page is removed or redirected, it will still remain in the traffic data to maintain the integrity of the analytics data. Pages cannot be removed from this report. The Pages report will track up to 20,000 unique external page URLs per month. Once that limit is exceeded, the report will then track a limit of 100 new unique external page URLs per day. Page views to external URLs beyond that limit will be bucketed under their domain rather than full page URL. Learn more about this limit below .

Other pages on domain If you're tracking an external site that generates over 20,000 new, unique URLs per month, review the limits below to understand how HubSpot will bucket your external page views. For performance reasons, the Pages report will only display page views per URL for up to 20,000 external pages per month . Once 20,000 new, unique external page URLs have been added to the report in a given month, the report will then display page views per page URL for up to 100 new unique page URLs per day . Any page views beyond this limit will be bucketed under the domain rather than the page URL. In the report, you'll see these views categorized as Other pages on domain . This limit only applies to URLs that the account has never previously tracked views for. Pages hosted on HubSpot do not count against this limit. For example, your website might be structured to create a new page per user, such as www.example.com/user/michaelscott . If you're tracking all of these external pages in HubSpot, the Pages report will display those page views as follows: If in August you receive 15,000 sign ups, meaning that 15,000 new user pages are created at unique URLs, the Pages report will display page views for each unique URL. If in September you receive 25,000 new sign ups, meaning 25,000 new user pages are created at unique URLs, the Pages report will display page views per unique URL for the first 20,000 pages. Since you've hit the monthly limit, the Pages report will continue to display page views per unique URL only for the first 100 new pages per day. All views for new, unique page URLs after that will be bucketed under the domain rather than individual pages. For the rest of the month, views for new pages beyond the first 100 per day will appear under Other pages on domain www.example.com . For websites that would exceed these limits, there are a couple options to avoid views being bucketed under Other pages on domain : Set a canonical URL in the affected pages' HTML headers, such as https://example.com/user . This will instruct HubSpot to track page views under one URL. Learn more about canonical URLs . For single-page applications, customize your HubSpot tracking code using the setPath function . Similar to the above, this will instruct HubSpot to track page views under the specified URL rather than each new, unique URL. Metrics Below are definitions for the metrics found within the traffic analytics tool. Sources , Topic clusters , UTM Parameters, Device types, Countries, and Browsers Sessions: a series of analytics activities taken by a visitor to your website. Sessions are not only page views, but include activities such as events, form submissions, and CTA clicks. Sessions expire after 30 minutes of visitor in activity . New sessions begin when a visitor returns to the site after 30 minutes of activity or with a new session campaign (e.g., the visitor returns to the site from a different traffic source). If a visitor prevents cookie tracking by using an extension or opting out of your cookie policy, and then submits a form, HubSpot will attempt to infer the context of the submission to more accurately record its source, usually through UTM parameters. Example scenarios of a session: Scenario 1 A visitor finds your site through organic search. They leave and only return to their computer after two hours. They continue to explore your site that was open in their browser and clicks a CTA. The first session expired during the two hours of inactivity and a second session was logged with a new source of direct traffic. This counts as 2 sessions , each with a different source. The first is organic search, and the second will be direct traffic. Scenario 2 A v isitor has an ad blocker installed in their browser to block cookies. HubSpot will be unable to track their page views. They access a landing page through a marketing email and submit a form. T hrough UTM parameters, HubSpot is able to attribute this to the email source . Scenario 3 A visitor finds a site via organic search, then leaves the website. Within 30 minutes, the visitor goes directly back to the website. This is counted as 1 session as the visitor returned within 30 minutes. The source is organic search. Session to contact rate: the number of form submissions divided by the number of unique visitors for the selected time period. New contacts: the number of new contacts created during the selected time period. The Pages report will only count contacts that are created from form submissions, while the Sources report includes contacts from all sources. Contact to customer rate: the percentage of new contacts created in the selected time period that eventually became customers. Customers: the number of customers who originally created during this time period and are currently in the lifecycle stage of Customer . Bounce rate: the percentage of visitors to a particular website who navigate away from the site after viewing only one page. New visitors: the number of new visitors on your website where one new session is counted for each tracked visitor. A visitor is someone who visits your site, tracked by the cookie placed in their browser by the HubSpot tracking code installed on your site. A single visitor can have multiple sessions and page views to your site. New session %: the percentage of sessions that are from new users. Page views / session: the a verage number of page views per session in the given time range. Avg. session length: the average duration of a visitor's website session. Pages Page views: the number of page views recorded in the designated time period. HubSpot counts a page view every time the HubSpot tracking code is loaded on a browser. Example scenarios of page views: Scenario 1 A visitor searches Google and accesses your site at www.website.com . This will count as one page view for www.website.com . Scenario 2 A visitor goes to your X account and clicks a link to your blog at blog.website.com . In your blog, they click a link in the menu to view your main site at www.website.com . This will count as two page views, one page view bucketed under blog.website.com and one page view for www.hubspot.com . Submissions: the number of submissions on a HubSpot form or meetings widget on your HubSpot page or blog post. This data does not include meeting modules added through an embed link on an external page . New contacts: the number of new contacts created during the selected date range. Customers: the number of customers whose first conversion occurred during the selected date range. Page view to submission rate: the number of submissions, as defined above, divided by the number of sessions for the selected date range. Page view to contact rate: the number of form submissions divided by the number of unique visitors for the selected time period. Page view to customer rate: the number of visitors who are currently in the lifecycle stage of Customer divided by the number of sessions for the selected time period. Entrances: the number of sessions on your website that started on this page. Exits: the number of visitors who ended their session on your website after viewing this page. Average time on page: the average time between the start and end of a page view. Bounce rate: the percentage of visitors to a particular website who navigate away from the site after viewing only one page. Exit rate: the percent of views on this page that were the last in a visitor's session on your site. CTA views: the number of CTA views on this page. CTA clicks: the number of clicks on a CTA on this page. AMP views (blog posts only): a breakdown of how many times the AMP version of your blog post was viewed compared to the number of times it was viewed on a desktop. CTA rate: the conversion rate of how many visitors clicked on a CTA they viewed on this page. Content type: the classification of the content. For example, knowledge article or blog post. The content type will only populate if the page's domain is connected to your HubSpot account .

649,Reset your two-factor authentication,"If you lose the device you use for two-factor authentication (2FA) , change your device, uninstall the HubSpot app , or are otherwise unable to access your 2FA method, you will need to reset your 2FA. A 2FA reset takes a minimum of 48-72 hours to ensure there is ample time to protect your account from bad actors if login information is compromised. For example, if a bad actor tries to access your account using compromised login credentials, the extra security steps for resetting your 2FA give you time and extra barriers to prevent the bad actor from accessing your account. Once your 2FA is reset, you can log in with only your username and password, and it is recommended that you set up your new 2FA method immediately. Users in a partner account can request a 2FA reset which will be routed to super admins in the partner account. Please note: the best way to ensure you retain access to your HubSpot account is to set up both primary and secondary methods for your 2FA login . When you set up 2FA, you will be provided with backup codes. You can download these codes as a PDF and save them to your device. The file name is backupCodes.pdf . The combination of a primary and secondary 2FA method (e.g. Google Authenticator, text message) as well as stored backup codes for recovery will give you the most secure and reliable two-factor authentication setup for your HubSpot account. To request a 2FA reset: On the HubSpot login screen , enter your login credentials. If you are unable to access your 2FA method, on the login verification screen, click one of the following options: Call me for the code: to receive a phone call with the code. Lost your authentication device?: to receive access from an account administrator or the HubSpot support team. Photo identification: to verify your account with a photo ID. Learn more about Nametag's automated account recovery with a photo ID. Don't see the login prompt? (HubSpot mobile app): to view instructions for how to find a login code in your app. If you have a new device, no longer have the original device, or uninstalled the authenticator app, click New device , Lost device , or Uninstalled device . Then, you can receive access from an account administrator or the HubSpot support team. If you are on a single account with super admins and your email isn't shared across multiple accounts, an email will be sent to one of your super admins to begin the reset process. You will receive an email with a code. You must share this code with one of your super admins to have your 2FA reset. Please note: If your account is eligible for Super Admins, only the first 10 account Super Admins will receive the reset email. If your account has Super Admins but you don't have access to them, in the email you receive, click Get help from Support to go through the Lost authentication device flow instead of the Super Admin reset flow. If you are the only administrator on your account, or you do not have an account with super admins, you will be prompted to send yourself an email with further verification instructions. Click on the link in the email to open a list of security questions. Once your answers are submitted, a member of the HubSpot support team will send you an email to help. A response takes between 48-72 hours. If you are on multiple accounts, then your oldest account will be considered for the reset process and will follow the appropriate procedure for the particular account. Account access is immediately granted once the super admin or HubSpot support team resets your 2FA. Once your 2FA has been reset, you can log in with your email address and password.

For example, you can use this to send an email when a form has been filled out or when a CTA has been clicked. Learn more about the differences between event triggers and filter-based criteria . Event triggers: trigger when an occurrence happens. For example, when a contact’s city changes to Dublin , do [X] action. Filter triggers: trigger when a criteria is met. For example, contact’s whose city is equal to Dublin , do [X] action. Before you get started When using event enrollment triggers, please note the following: You cannot test record enrollment using event enrollment triggers. When testing enrollment, only filters in the AND only enroll contacts that also meet these filters used section will be taken into account . For an event enrollment to trigger, the record must be created before the event occurs. For example, a website visitor completes a custom event that has been set as an event enrollment trigger, but only becomes a HubSpot contact a minute later. In this instance, as the contact was created after the custom event occurred, they will not be enrolled. You cannot use scheduled triggers with event enrollment triggers. Call event triggers can only be used with calls initiated from HubSpot . When using marketing emails to set your event enrollment triggers: Only A/B marketing and automated marketing emails can be used for event enrollment. If a specific marketing email is not defined, actions taken on all marketing emails, including batch marketing emails, can cause a record to meet the event enrollment trigger. Set event enrollment triggers When setting up event enrollment triggers, all triggers will be separated using the OR operator. This means that only one of the event enrollment triggers must occur for the record to enroll in the workflow. To set up your event enrollment triggers: In your HubSpot account, navigate to Automations > Workflows . Click the name of the workflow or create a new workflow . In the workflow editor, click Set up triggers . In the left panel, select the When an event occurs . In the Add Trigger panel, select an event trigger .

To add another trigger group, click + Add trigger group and continue setting up your trigger group. After setting up your event triggers, click Done . To further refine the records enrolled in the workflow based on additional filters, in the AND only enroll contacts that also meet these filters section, click + Add filter . You can select additional properties to refine the records that you would like to enroll in the workflow. Your event triggers must be saved before you can add additional refinement filters. When using refining filter criteria, the record must also meet these filters when the event from the main trigger occurs. By default, records will only enroll in a workflow the first time they meet the enrollment triggers. To turn on re-enrollment, under the Should [object] be re-enrolled in this workflow? section, select Yes, re-enroll every time the trigger occurs . When you're done, click Save . Change your workflow enrollment trigger type If you've previously created a workflow using When a filter criteria is met or Based on a schedule triggers, you can update the workflow to use When an event occurs triggers.
